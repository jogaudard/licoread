Climate warming causes melting and ultimately breakup of ice shelves, which could escalate ocean-bound ice discharge and thereby sea-level rise. Should ice shelves collapse, it is unclear whether they could recover, even if we meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Here, we use a numerical ice-sheet model to determine if Petermann Ice Shelf in northwest Greenland can recover from a future breakup. Our experiments suggest that post-breakup recovery of confined ice shelves like Petermann's is unlikely, unless iceberg calving is greatly reduced. Ice discharge from Petermann Glacier also remains up to 40\% higher than today, even if the ocean cools below present-day temperatures. If this behaviour is not unique for Petermann, continued near-future ocean warming may push the ice shelves protecting Earth's polar ice sheets into a new retreated high-discharge state which may be exceedingly difficult to recover from.},

  abstract = {Decomposition of plant litter is an important process in the terrestrial carbon cycle and makes up approximately 70\% of the global carbon flux from soils to the atmosphere. Climate change is expected to have significant direct and indirect effects on the litter decomposition processes at various timescales. Using the TeaBag Index, we investigated the impact on decomposition of short-term direct effects of temperature and precipitation by comparing temporal variability over years, versus long-term climate impacts that incorporate indirect effects mediated through environmental changes by comparing sites along climatic gradients. We measured the initial decomposition rate (k) and the stabilization factor (S; amount of labile litter stabilizing) across a climate grid combining three levels of summer temperature (6.5--10.5{$^\circ$}C) with four levels of annual precipitation (600--2700~mm) in three summers with varying temperature and precipitation. Several (a)biotic factors were measured to characterize environmental differences between sites. Increased temperatures enhanced k, whereas increased precipitation decreased k across years and climatic regimes. In contrast, S showed diverse responses to annual changes in temperature and precipitation between climate regimes. Stabilization of labile litter fractions increased with temperature only in boreal and sub-alpine sites, while it decreased with increasing precipitation only in sub-alpine and alpine sites. Environmental factors such as soil pH, soil C/N, litter C/N, and plant diversity that are associated with long-term climate variation modulate the response of k and S. This highlights the importance of long-term climate in shaping the environmental conditions that influences the response of decomposition processes to climate change.},

Therefore, plant stress is increased not only by drought in warmer months, but also by increased exposure to frost in cooler periods. We conducted a 4-year field experiment to evaluate the effects of diminished snowpack accumulation (through snow removal) and rainfall reduction (through rain-out shelters) on aboveground plant productivity, diversity and species composition of two subalpine grassland plant communities from the central region of the Spanish Pyrenees. We found that the snow removal treatment decreased minimum soil temperature by 0.5{$^\circ$}C. Plant diversity decreased by 16 percent, although this effect was only observed in one of the grasslands studied. Aboveground primary productivity seemed to be unaffected. In contrast, we found that the rainfall reduction treatment negatively affected aboveground productivity of leguminous forb species, yet no effect on plant diversity was observed. Both treatments were important drivers of changes in plant species composition. Overall, our results suggest that the resilience of subalpine grasslands to snow cover removal and rainfall reduction treatments may depend on the specific community composition and dominant plant groups.},

Theory predicts that when apex predators disappear, large herbivores become less fearful, occupy new habitats, and modify those habitats by eating new food plants. Yet experimental support for this prediction has been difficult to obtain in large-mammal systems. After the extirpation of leopards and African wild dogs from Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park, forest-dwelling antelopes [bushbuck (Tragelaphus sylvaticus)] expanded into treeless floodplains, where they consumed novel diets and suppressed a common food plant [waterwort (Bergia mossambicensis)]. By experimentally simulating predation risk, we demonstrate that this behavior was reversible. Thus, whereas anthropogenic predator extinction disrupted a trophic cascade by enabling rapid differentiation of prey behavior, carnivore restoration may just as rapidly reestablish that cascade.},

  abstract = {Non-steady-state closed dynamic accumulation chambers are widely used to measure the respiration of terrestrial ecosystems, thanks to their low cost, low energy consumption and simple transportability, that allow measurements even in hostile and remote environments. However, the assessment of the accuracy and precision associated with the measurement system (independently of possible disturbances due to chamber-soil interactions) is rarely reported. This information is instead necessary for basic quality control, to compare data obtained by different devices and regression models and to provide Confidence Intervals (CIs) on the carbon flux values. This study quantifies the uncertainty associated with emission flux measurements, with a focus on very low fluxes. Calibration tests using different accumulation chambers and CO2 sensors were performed, and fluxes were calculated by means of different models (parametric, non-parametric and flux models). The results of this work show that the linear regression model has the best reproducibility when compared to the other tested models, regardless of the sensor used and the chamber volumes, while the second order polynomial regression has the best accuracy. We remark the importance of building a calibration curve in the range of the expected flux values, with an interval between the lowest and highest imposed flux that should not exceed two orders of magnitude. To evaluate the reproducibility of the measurement, performing replicates for each imposed flux value is essential. We also show that it is necessary to carefully identify the best time interval for interpolating the CO2 concentration curve in order to guarantee reproducibility and accuracy in flux estimates.},

Norwegian Institute for Nature Research.  This report discusses approximate estimations of the carbon budgets within Norway's mainland ecosystems. It stands as an initial overview of the natural potential of carbon storage and sequestration in Norwegian ecosystems. We describe carbon cycling in five key ecosystem groups: forest, alpine and cryosphere, agriculture and grassland, wetland, and freshwater and nearshore ecosystems. We emphasise the vital ecosystem service that Norwegian landscapes and ecosystems provide in sequestering carbon, and how climate change and management practices may aggravate or mitigate this function. We find that the largest stores of carbon in Norway are in the forests (32\%) which also cover 38\% of the total land area. Wetlands and permafrost cover 9\% and 3\% of the total land mass respectively, yet are storing over 2.2 Pg C, 31\% of the nation's carbon. These two ecosystems are the most carbon dense ecosystems per km2, with 53 and 48 kg C m-2 for wetlands and permafrost respectively. The next densest storage of carbon can be found in freshwater lake sediments, with 45 kg C m-2, amounting to 13\% of all carbon stores. Forests and low-mid alpine zones sequester the most carbon on an annual basis (5.5 and 5.3 Tg C yr-1, respectively), with soils in alpine heathlands contributing the most to alpine carbon stores. In considering the carbon stored in key ecosystems, we find that Norway contains approximately 0.18\% of all global carbon stocks, with a land mass that is 0.07\% of the planet. This high carbon-to-area ratio is likely due to the large proportion of the country that is carbon rich peatlands (alpine and lowland) and boreal forest.  Since ratifying the Paris Agreement, Norway has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050, yet is presently one of the highest CO2/CO2-e emitters per capita in Europe, and within the top 20\% of emitters globally. The main terrestrial ecosystems that are included in the emissions reporting system for Norway include forest, arable land and farm grazing land, infrastructure areas, and a small portion of the total area of mire, as well as land-use changes among these areas. However, a large portion of the remaining land area in Norway is to a limited extent included in the accounting, although its carbon emissions and sink capacity can be significantly affected by management practices and/or conversion. Currently non-managed areas such as wetlands, alpine zones, freshwater sediments, habitats included in non-agricultural open lowland classes, and the cryosphere including permafrost, are not adequately considered in carbon reporting, especially due to limitations in area representation and knowledge gaps concerning carbon uptake, storage and emissions in these systems, and concerning the consequences of land use change on carbon stocks. These areas account for more than half of the land cover of Norway and could account for approximately 68\% of the nation's carbon stores. Additionally, coastal ecosystems, such as kelp forests are also not included, yet play a key role in both carbon budgets and bio-diversity measures.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) finds that the conservation and enhancement of carbon sinks and natural carbon stores is one of the surest ways for us to com-bat the extremes of climate change. The most efficient and cost-effective process is by using existing ecosystems. Current national inventories do consider the changes in land use, and how this may impact carbon emissions. However, much of the regularly assessed land types are biased towards managed ecosystems, and there is currently no framework for how to incorporate impacts on biodiversity. The loss of biodiversity is accelerating, and that has negative consequences for populations, species, communities and ecosystems, and thus ecosystem services, including those underpinning the capacity for climate mitigation and adaptation. The recent reports from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES Global Assessment 2019) and the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC Land Report 2019) both point to biodiversity and ecosystems as underpinning climate actions. They also emphasise the necessity of developing mixes of instruments that make best use of synergistic opportunities that can motivate land-owners and other decision-makers to make decisions that both conserve biodiversity and ecosystem integrity and deliver high levels of ecosystem services. The latter includes reduced greenhouse gas emissions and increased removals. Ensuring a diverse portfolio of healthy ecosystems, either through conservation of already existing ones or by restoring degraded ones, will have the greatest value of ecosystem services and ensure the highest chance of adaptability to climate change pressures in the future. The ability of non-managed and seemingly unproductive ecosystems, such as alpine landscapes, to sequester and store carbon is significant.  We suggest that, in addition to a `Klimakur' (``climate cure''), there is a need for a `Naturkur' (``nature cure'') to implement a strategy for biodiversity and ecosystem services following-up the findings and recommendations from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bio-diversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the new international commitments under the Bio-diversity Convention (CBD), and the national implementation of the Norwegian ``Nature for Life'' white paper (Meld. St. 14 (2015-2016), Ministry of Climate and Environment 2015). A Naturkur would emphasise the value of maintaining a diverse portfolio of ecosystems at a national level, ecosystems that are inextricably interlinked with carbon storage, sequestration capacity and bio-diversity itself, and of finding solutions that can help achieve multiple objectives by proposing synergistic measures. Or rather, a harmonized Klima-Naturkur, where actions for climate mitigation and adaptation, and for biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation are not designed independently, but address societal challenges in a coordinated manner, are synergistic, and reinforce each other to achieve multiple benefits.},

  abstract = {Reaching climate goals depends on appropriate and accurate methods to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and to verify that efforts to mitigate GHG emissions are effective. We here highlight critical advantages, limitations, and needs regarding GHG flux measurement methods, identified from an analysis of {$>$}13 500 scientific publications regarding three long-lived GHGs, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). While existing methods are well-suited for assessing atmospheric changes and local fluxes, they are expensive and have limited accessibility. Further, we are typically forced to choose between methods for very local GHG sources and sinks and their regulation (m2-scaled measurements), or methods for aggregated net fluxes at {$>$}ha or km2 scales measurements. The results highlight the key need of accessible and affordable GHG flux measurement methods for the many flux types not quantifiable from fossil fuel use, to better verify inventories and mitigation efforts for transparency and accountability under the Paris agreement. The situation also calls for novel methods, capable of quantifying large scale GHG flux patterns while simultaneously distinguishing local source and sink dynamics and reveal flux regulation, representing key knowledge for quantitative GHG flux modeling. Possible strategies to address the identified GHG flux measurement method needs are discussed. The analysis also generated indications of how GHG flux measurements have been distributed geographically and across flux types, which are reported.},

  abstract = {A systematic review and inventory of recent research relating to optical remote sensing of Arctic vegetation was conducted, and thematic and geographical trends were summarized. Research was broadly categorized into four major themes of (1) time series, including NDVI trends and shrub expansion; (2) disturbance and recovery, including tundra fires, winter warming, herbivory, permafrost disturbance, and anthropogenic change; (3) vegetation properties, including biomass, primary productivity, seasonality, phenology, and pigments; and (4) classification and mapping. Remaining challenges associated with remote sensing of Arctic vegetation were divided into three categories and discussed. The first are issues related to environmental controls including disturbance, hydrology, plant functional types, phenology and the tundra-taiga ecotone, and understanding their influence on interpretation and validation of derived remote sensing trends. The second are issues of upscaling and extrapolation related to sensor physics and the comparability of data from multiple spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. The final category identifies more philosophical challenges surrounding the future of data accessibility, big data analysis, sharing and funding policies among major data providers such as national space agencies and private companies, as well as user groups in the public and private sectors. The review concludes that the best practices for the advancement of optical remote sensing of Arctic vegetation include (1) a continued effort to share and improve in situ-validated datasets using camera networks and small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, (2) data fusion with non-optical data, (3) sensor continuity, consistency, and comparability, and (4) free availability and increased sharing of data. These efforts are necessary to generate high quality, temporally dense datasets for identifying trends in Arctic tundra vegetation.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that climate warming is causing shrub cover to increase at high latitudes. Increased shrub cover generally lowers surface albedo, which results in higher energy absorption and further warming. In parts of Fennoscandia, herbivory is known to control vegetation height and abundance, and thus preventing this positive feedback. Here, we combine field measurements of albedo, herbivory and vegetation characteristics in four topographically-defined vegetation types of varying shrub height and abundance with land surface modeling (JULES) to investigate if reindeer grazing can influence the energy balance of an arctic tundra. We find that when reindeer reduces shrub height and abundance, summer albedo increases in both Betula nana-dominated heath vegetation and Salix glauca-dominated willow depressions. Model results reveal associated lower net radiation, and latent and sensible heat fluxes in heavily-grazed sites in all shrub-dominated vegetation types. Our results also suggest that the structural shift from graminoid to shrub tundra drives the difference in summer albedo, rather than shifts from dwarf-shrub to tall-shrub tundra. Reindeer has thus a potential cooling effect on climate by increasing summer albedo and decreasing net radiation, which highlights the importance of mammalian herbivores for the earth system beyond their local grazing impacts. However, the strong effects of reindeer on albedo are probably restricted to areas with high reindeer densities, since a dramatic vegetation change is essential. The importance of these processes across the whole range of reindeer densities found in the arctic tundra needs to be further evaluated.},

  abstract = {Arctic warming can influence tundra ecosystem function with consequences for climate feedbacks, wildlife and human communities. Yet ecological change across the Arctic tundra biome remains poorly quantified due to field measurement limitations and reliance on coarse-resolution satellite data. Here, we assess decadal changes in Arctic tundra greenness using time series from the 30\,m resolution Landsat satellites. From 1985 to 2016 tundra greenness increased (greening) at {\textasciitilde}37.3\% of sampling sites and decreased (browning) at {\textasciitilde}4.7\% of sampling sites. Greening occurred most often at warm sampling sites with increased summer air temperature, soil temperature, and soil moisture, while browning occurred most often at cold sampling sites that cooled and dried. Tundra greenness was positively correlated with graminoid, shrub, and ecosystem productivity measured at field sites. Our results support the hypothesis that summer warming stimulated plant productivity across much, but not all, of the Arctic tundra biome during recent decades.},

Yet to date, no globally consistent assessment of permafrost temperature change has been compiled. Here we use a global data set of permafrost temperature time series from the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost to evaluate temperature change across permafrost regions for the period since the International Polar Year (2007--2009). During the reference decade between 2007 and 2016, ground temperature near the depth of zero annual amplitude in the continuous permafrost zone increased by 0.39\,{\textpm}\,0.15\,{$^\circ$}C. Over the same period, discontinuous permafrost warmed by 0.20\,{\textpm}\,0.10\,{$^\circ$}C. Permafrost in mountains warmed by 0.19\,{\textpm}\,0.05\,{$^\circ$}C and in Antarctica by 0.37\,{\textpm}\,0.10\,{$^\circ$}C. Globally, permafrost temperature increased by 0.29\,{\textpm}\,0.12\,{$^\circ$}C. The observed trend follows the Arctic amplification of air temperature increase in the Northern Hemisphere. In the discontinuous zone, however, ground warming occurred due to increased snow thickness while air temperature remained statistically unchanged.},

  abstract = {Changes in Arctic vegetation can have important implications for trophic interactions and ecosystem functioning leading to climate feedbacks. Plot-based vegetation surveys provide detailed insight into vegetation changes at sites around the Arctic and improve our ability to predict the impacts of environmental change on tundra ecosystems. Here, we review studies of changes in plant community composition and phenology from both long-term monitoring and warming experiments in Arctic environments. We find that Arctic plant communities and species are generally sensitive to warming, but trends over a period of time are heterogeneous and complex and do not always mirror expectations based on responses to experimental manipulations. Our findings highlight the need for more geographically widespread, integrated, and comprehensive monitoring efforts that can better resolve the interacting effects of warming and other local and regional ecological factors.},

However, snow-cover and snowpack conditions change through time pose challenges for measuring and prediction of snow. Plausible scenarios of how Arctic snow cover will respond to changing Arctic climate are important for impact assessments and adaptation strategies. Although much progress has been made in understanding and predicting snow-cover changes and their multiple consequences, many uncertainties remain. In this paper, we review advances in snow monitoring and modelling, and the impact of snow changes on ecosystems and society in Arctic regions. Interdisciplinary activities are required to resolve the current limitations on measuring and modelling snow characteristics through the cold season and at different spatial scales to assure human well-being, economic stability, and improve the ability to predict manage and adapt to natural hazards in the Arctic region.},

Temperature variation is typically considered the main driver of daily plant respiration rates, assuming a constant daily respiration rate at a set temperature. Here, we show empirical data from 31 species from temperate and tropical biomes to demonstrate that the rate of plant respiration at a constant temperature decreases monotonically with time through the night, on average by 25\% after 8\,h of darkness. Temperature controls less than half of the total nocturnal variation in respiration. A new universal formulation is developed to model and understand nocturnal plant respiration, combining the nocturnal decrease in the rate of plant respiration at constant temperature with the decrease in plant respiration according to the temperature sensitivity. Application of the new formulation shows a global reduction of 4.5 -6 \% in plant respiration and an increase of 7-10\% in net primary production for the present-day.},

  abstract = {There is a research reproducibility crisis, including in ecology. The research pipeline from conception to publication has many cracks, which means that it may not be possible to repeat and verify published results. Reproducibility means that the results of a study can be reproduced from the original data. It is a critical step in the quality assurance of a study; indeed, the re-use and subsequent citation of methods from reproducible research can increase the impact of the work beyond the findings of the specific study. Given the original data, code and documentation, in theory, all research results could be reproduced. However, sufficient information must be available to understand and reproduce the data handling, analysis and modelling. Information should also be accessible, enabling reproduction with reasonable effort. Various open-source software options exist that allow scientists to easily annotate their scripts in a way that makes it simple to produce dynamic documents that give a more accessible account of the analysis (html, pdf and various word processor file types). Popular software options---including Jupyter notebooks, the R markdown package and the new multi-language Quarto application---produce documents that weave together the input code and software-generated output (text, tables, and figures) with the author's explanatory text to produce a clear narrative of the analysis process. Therefore, we now encourage the submission of supplementary dynamic documents to the Journal of Ecology to improve the reproducibility and transparency of research published in the journal. Reproducibility can be assessed prior to the submission of the work for publication, during peer review and post-publication. Authors are encouraged to provide three file types: the data, an executable dynamic document and a static reproducibility PDF file that integrates and annotates the input code with the statistical output. We provide some basic examples of dynamic documents for reproducibility.},

However, few quantitative global projections of litter carbon release rate in response to climate change exist. Here, we combined a global foliar litter carbon release dataset (8973 samples) to generate spatially explicitly estimates of the response of their residence time ({$\tau$}) to climate change. Results show a global mean litter carbon release rate (k{\textbackslash} k {\textbackslash}) of 0.69 year-1 (ranging from 0.09--5.6 year-1). Under future climate scenarios, global mean {$\tau$} is projected to decrease by a mean of 2.7\% (SSP 1--2.6) and 5.9\% (SSP 5--8.5) during 2071--2100 period. Locally, the alleviation of temperature and moisture restrictions corresponded to obvious decreases in {$\tau$} in cold and arid regions, respectively. In contract, {$\tau$} in tropical humid broadleaf forests increased by 4.6\% under SSP 5--8.5. Our findings highlight the vegetation type as a powerful proxy for explaining global patterns in foliar litter carbon release rates and the role of climate conditions in predicting responses of carbon release to climate change. Our observation-based estimates could refine carbon cycle parameterization, improving projections of carbon cycle--climate feedbacks.},

In this study, We used the four latest leaf area index (LAI) datasets to explore this controversial topic, and found that global greening was not only present (trend between 3.1--6.4~{\texttimes}10-3 m2 m-2 yr-1) but also continued (growth rate trend between 3.3--6.4~{\texttimes}10-4 m2 m-2 yr-2) during 2001--2020. Greening acceleration occurred in 55.15\% of the globe (positive trend and positive growth rate trend), while browning acceleration occurred in only 7.28\% (negative trend and positive growth rate trend). Combined with meteorological variables, we found that CO2 change dominated the LAI trend, while climate change largely determined the LAI growth rate trend. Importantly, our study highlighted that drought trend did not necessarily trigger vegetation browning, but slowed down the rate of greening.},

Moreover, experimental warming only promotes total soil CO2 efflux by 7-8\% on average in the meta-analysis across all grasslands or alpine grasslands globally (none of these experiments were whole-soil warming).

The comparison between CRDS and GC showed that average CO2 fluxes were significantly higher for CRDS in both the laboratory and field, but the same experimental treatments effects were detected for both techniques. Compared to CRDS, the GC technique was severely limited in detecting CH4 fluxes in both the laboratory and field. Thus, only 16\% of measured GC fluxes were detectable in the laboratory and none in the field whereas CRDS could detect 65\% and 97\% of the CH4 fluxes in the laboratory and field. In contrast, N2O fluxes measured with CRDS and GC were not different for both the laboratory and field. It was observed that a lower proportion of N2O fluxes could be detected with CRDS (73\%) than GC (92\%) in the laboratory and similar recovery (65\% and 68\%) for the field. Thus, the same treatment effects were observed for both CRDS and GC. Furthermore, the comparison between CRDS and GC showed that enclosure times as short as 600s for our field study site are suitable to estimate the same treatment effects, but not necessarily flux magnitude. We conclude that CRDS and GC can provide the same level of information regarding treatment effects in both laboratory and field experiments for CO2 and N2O, but not for CH4 and it is possible to reduce enclosure time without comprising comparability between the two techniques.},

  abstract = {Grasslands are heavily relied upon for food and forage production. A key component for sustaining production in grassland ecosystems is the maintenance of soil organic matter (SOM), which can be strongly influenced by management. Many management techniques intended to increase forage production may potentially increase SOM, thus sequestering atmospheric carbon (C). Further, conversion from either cultivation or native vegetation into grassland could also sequester atmospheric carbon. We reviewed studies examining the influence of improved grassland management practices and conversion into grasslands on soil C worldwide to assess the potential for C sequestration. Results from 115 studies containing over 300 data points were analyzed. Management improvements included fertilization (39\%), improved grazing management (24\%), conversion from cultivation (15\%) and native vegetation (15\%), sowing of legumes (4\%) and grasses (2\%), earthworm introduction (1\%), and irrigation (1\%). Soil C content and concentration increased with improved management in 74\% of the studies, and mean soil C increased with all types of improvement. Carbon sequestration rates were highest during the first 40 yr after treatments began and tended to be greatest in the top 10 cm of soil. Impacts were greater in woodland and grassland biomes than in forest, desert, rain forest, or shrubland biomes. Conversion from cultivation, the introduction of earthworms, and irrigation resulted in the largest increases. Rates of C sequestration by type of improvement ranged from 0.11 to 3.04 Mg C{$\cdot$}ha-1 yr-1, with a mean of 0.54 Mg C{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1, and were highly influenced by biome type and climate. We conclude that grasslands can act as a significant carbon sink with the implementation of improved management.},

We used a multi-method approach of ecological field surveys to quantify the biophysical supply and socio-cultural values of ecosystem services (ES) in four different vegetation types representing managed open vegetation, natural forest types for abandonment and planted forests to represent afforestation. We explored the match and/or mismatch between socio-cultural values and biophysical supply of ES in those vegetation types and investigated the socio-demographic factors that influence socio-cultural values for ES. Biophysical supply of ES was variable across vegetation types and synergies were as common as trade-offs. Socio-cultural values were high for most ES in open vegetation and natural forests and low for planted forests. Biophysical supply and socio-cultural values were well matched across the vegetation types for biodiversity and agricultural products, but strongly mismatched for climate regulation. We show that although trade-offs occur both within value- and between value domains, synergies are also common. Our results show that abandonment would impact on the biophysical supply and socio-cultural values of some ES but that this impact would be lower than that of afforestation. We argue that our approach can be used to manage trade-offs and enhance synergies between value domains for a holistic approach to landscape stewardship that supports both people and nature.},

  abstract = {Mountain ecosystems play an important role globally as centers of biodiversity and in providing ecosystem services to lowland populations, but are influenced by multiple global change drivers such as climate change, nitrogen deposition, or altered disturbance regimes. As global change is accelerating and the consequences for humans and nature are intensifying, there is an increasing demand for understanding and predicting the impacts and implications of global change on mountain ecosystems. Manipulation experiments are one of the major tools for testing the causal impacts of global change and establishing a mechanistic understanding of how these changes may transform the global biota from single organisms to entire ecosystems. Over the past three decades, hundreds of such experiments have been conducted in mountainous regions worldwide. To strengthen the experimental evidence for the possible ecological consequences of global change, we systematically reviewed the literature on global change experiments in mountains. We first investigated the spread of manipulation experiments to test the effects of different global change drivers on key biological and ecological processes from the organism to the ecosystem level. We then examined and discussed the balance of evidence regarding the impact of these global change drivers on biological and ecological processes, and outlined the possible consequences for mountain ecosystems. Finally, we identified research gaps and proposed future directions for global change research in mountain environments. Among the major drivers, temperature was manipulated most frequently, generally showing consistent strong impacts between biological and ecosystem processes, functional groups, and habitat types. There is also strong evidence suggesting that changes in water and nutrient availability have a direct impact on the life history and functioning of mountain organisms. Despite these important findings, there are several gaps that require urgent attention. These include experiments testing adult trees in tropical and boreal regions, assessing animal responses and biotic interactions, and investigating aquatic environments and soil systems more extensively. A broader approach that integrates experimental data with field observations and relies on international collaboration through coordinated experiments could help address these gaps and provide a more consistent and robust picture of the impacts of global change on mountain ecosystems.},

As a result, microclimate monitoring is increasingly being integrated in many studies in ecology and evolution. Overviews of the protocols and measurement methods related to microclimate are needed, especially for those starting in the field and to achieve more generality and standardisation in microclimate studies. Here, we present 10 practical guidelines for ground-based research of terrestrial microclimates, covering methods and best practices from initial conceptualisation of the study to data analyses. Our guidelines encompass the significance of microclimates; the specifics of what, where, when and how to measure them; the design of microclimate studies; and the optimal approaches for analysing and sharing data for future use and collaborations. The paper is structured as a chronological guide, leading the reader through each step necessary to conduct a comprehensive microclimate study. At the end, we also discuss further research avenues and development in this field. With these 10 guidelines for microclimate monitoring, we hope to stimulate and advance microclimate research in ecology and evolution, especially under the pressing need to account for buffering or amplifying abilities of contrasting microhabitats in the context of global climate change.},

Species can respond to changed climate with phenotypic plasticity or genetic adaptation, and these responses might vary at different levels of advanced and delayed snowmelt time. Here we mimicked future climate change projections for western Norway by transplanting individuals of Ranunculus acris towards warmer, wetter and warmer \& wetter climates. And we replicated the experiment along regional-scale temperature and precipitation gradients. This setup resulted in both advanced (warmer and warmer \& wetter transplants) and delayed (wetter transplants) snowmelt in the experimental sites. We recorded phenological development and growth over one growing season. The reproductive phenology of the transplanted R. acris individuals was affected by both phenotypic plasticity and genetic differences between populations of different origins, while growth showed only plastic responses. Plants expressed high plasticity to both advanced and delayed snowmelt time by acceleration of the onset of buds, flowers and fruits. Only the plants from wet and high-elevation sites showed a small response to advanced SMT. The late snowmelt time these populations experience could potentially cause high selection pressure leading to more constrains in plasticity. When grown under common conditions, plants from late snowmelt sites responded with earlier onset of phenological development, suggesting that the timing of snowmelt exerts strong selection on reproduction. To project species fates under future climate we need to consider the interplay between genetic adaptation and plastic responses under different climate contexts, especially towards the species range limits.},

Measurements were performed concurrently with dynamic (flow through) enclosure measurements with sulfur-free air used as sweep gas. This latter technique has been used to acquire the majority of available data on the exchange of S gases between the atmosphere and the continental surfaces and has been criticized because it is thought to overestimate the true flux of gases by disrupting natural S gas gradients. DMS emission rates determined by both methods were not statistically different between 4 and {$>$}400 nmol m-2 h-1, indicating that previous data on emissions of at least DMS are probably valid. However, the increase in DMS in static enclosures was not linear, indicating the potential for a negative feedback of enclosure DMS concentrations on efflux. The dynamic enclosure method measured positive OCS flux rates (emission) at all sites, while data using static enclosures indicated that OCS was consumed from the atmosphere at these same sites at rates of 3.7 to 55 nmol m-2 h-1. Measurements using both enclosure techniques at a site devoid of vegetation showed that peat was a source of both DMS and OCS. However, the rate of OCS efflux from decomposing peat was more than counterbalanced by OCS consumption by vegetation, including Sphagnum mosses, and net OCS uptake occurred at all sites. We propose that all wetlands are net sinks for OCS.},

Here, a temporary warming of the Arctic entails important legacy effects and we show that feedbacks between water-, energy- and carbon cycles allow for multiple steady-states in permafrost regions, which differ with respect to the physical state of the soil, the soil carbon concentrations and the terrestrial carbon uptake and -release. The steady-states depend on the soil organic matter content at the point of climate stabilization, which is significantly affected by an overshoot-induced soil carbon loss.},

To put together those fragments, solve those meta-problems, and integrate our efforts more efficiently we suggest a tentative Canonical Ecology Curriculum to be used for training the next generations of ecologists. Such a curriculum should be structured around a backbone of robust theories, classical case studies, and common methods, which we can expect to be taught in any graduate programme worldwide. This would minimise the ambiguity of what an ecologist learns in different countries and continents, strengthen our common vocabulary for internal communication, and help us bridge basic and applied Ecology more efficiently. This minimalistic backbone would leave plenty of room for the ``free programme'', so that each institution also teaches knowledge and skills relevant to its own reality. To achieve this aim, we propose to focus on eight spatiotemporal scales, very much in line with current textbooks, but in reverse order: from global to genetic. This would be consistent with our ability to understand and predict, as aggregated entities average out the idiosyncrasies of lower organisational levels. We close on a call for global collaboration to exchange experiences, define common goals, develop the curriculum, and operationalise its use for real-world teaching.},

  abstract = {Decomposition is a key flux of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere. Therefore, gaining a better understanding of how plant litter decomposes in soil, and what governs this process, is vital for global climate models. The Tea Bag Index (TBI) was introduced by Keuskamp et al. (2013) as a novel method for measuring litter decomposition rate and stabilisation. The TBI uses two types of tea bags representing fast (green tea) and slow (rooibos tea) decomposition substrates as standardised litter bags. To date, the TBI method has been used in over 2000 locations across the globe. However, before now, there has been no information on how the composition of the tea leaves change during incubation. These data are crucial in determining the validity of the use of the TBI method globally, to ensure the tea leaves decompose in a way that is representative of so-called ``native'' litters. To provide chemical underpinning of the TBI method, a laboratory incubation of the tea bags was conducted with destructive sampling at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, and 91\,d. The incubated tea was analysed for total C and N. In addition, C was characterised as alkyl, O-alkyl, aromatic, or carbonyl C using solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with cross-polarization and magic angle spinning (CPMAS NMR). The results suggest that changes in carbon in both tea types are comparable to other litter studies, with a net decrease in total C and relative proportion of O-alkyl C fraction, which contains carbohydrates and cellulose. We conclude that the decomposition of tea leaves in the bags used in the TBI is representative of other litters.},

However, soil carbon flux datasets are frequently low-resolution across either space or time, limiting our abilities to identify small-scale ecological contexts that influence soil carbon dynamics. Existing datasets are distributed unevenly, with some soil carbon-rich regions (like tropical grasslands) significantly understudied. We developed an autonomous, inexpensive, do-it-yourself (DIY) soil carbon flux chamber (a ``fluxbot'') and data processing software. We deployed a distributed array of 12 fluxbots in a long-term experiment in a central Kenyan savanna where it has been logistically impossible to collect high-resolution soil carbon flux data. With this array we collected over 10,000 individual flux estimates over almost two months, spanning the end of a dry season and the start of a wet season. With our successful deployment in situ, we demonstrate the potential for low-cost, autonomous, DIY sensors in improving resolution of soil carbon flux datasets (particularly in under-studied or logistically challenging systems). If implemented widely, such an improvement in data collection capacities could improve our understanding of ecological and climatic drivers of soil carbon flux dynamics on the local to global scale.},

The concentration change in the chamber is monitored over time, and the flux is usually calculated by the slope of a linear regression function. Theoretically, the gas exchange cannot be constant over time but has to decrease, when the concentration gradient between chamber headspace and soil air decreases. In this study, we test whether we can detect this non-linearity in the concentration change during the chamber closure with six air samples. We expect generally a low concentration gradient on dry sites (hummocks) and thus the occurrence of exponential concentration changes in the chamber due to a quick equilibrium of gas concentrations between peat and chamber headspace. On wet (flarks) and sedge-covered sites (lawns), we expect a high gradient and near-linear concentration changes in the chamber. To evaluate these model assumptions, we calculate both linear and exponential regressions for a test data set (n~=~597) from a Finnish mire. We use the Akaike Information Criterion with small sample second order bias correction to select the best-fitted model. 13.6\%, 19.2\% and 9.8\% of measurements on hummocks, lawns and flarks, respectively, were best fitted with an exponential regression model. A flux estimation derived from the slope of the exponential function at the beginning of the chamber closure can be significantly higher than using the slope of the linear regression function. Non-linear concentration-over-time curves occurred mostly during periods of changing water table. This could be due to either natural processes or chamber artefacts, e.g. initial pressure fluctuations during chamber deployment. To be able to exclude either natural processes or artefacts as cause of non-linearity, further information, e.g. CH4 concentration profile measurements in the peat, would be needed. If this is not available, the range of uncertainty can be substantial. We suggest to use the range between the slopes of the exponential regression at the beginning and at the end of the closure time as an estimate of the overall uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The poleward range shift of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) {$>$} 1,700 km into the Arctic is one of the most remarkable distribution changes of the early twentieth century. While this expansion threatens a smaller arctic ecological equivalent, the arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), the case became a textbook example of climate-driven range shifts. We tested this classical climate change hypothesis linked to an important range shift which has attracted little research thus far. We analysed Canadian fur harvest data from the Hudson's Bay Company Archives (14 trading posts; 1926--1950), testing hypotheses based on changes in summer and winter climates. Summer warming might have triggered a bottom-up increase in ecosystem productivity, while winter warming might have lowered thermal stress, both favouring red fox expansion. Additionally, we evaluated the hypothesis that red fox expansion was driven by the appearance of human sedentary sites (n = 110) likely bringing food subsidies into the unproductive tundra. Analysis of red fox expansion chronologies showed that expansion speed was higher during warmer winters. However, the expansions occurred under both cooling and warming trends, being faster during cooler summers in the Baffin Island region. The increasing proportion of red fox in fox fur harvests was best explained by human activity, while generalized linear mixed models also revealed a marginal effect of warmer winters. Generalized additive models confirmed human presence as the most important factor explaining rates of change in the proportion of red fox in fox fur harvests. Using historical ecology, we disentangled the relative influences of climate change and anthropogenic habitat change, two global drivers that transformed arctic biodiversity during the last century and will likely continue to do so during this century. Anthropogenic food subsidies, which constitute stable food sources, facilitated the invasion of the tundra biome by a new mammalian predator and competitor, with long-term consequences that still remain to be understood.},

We present a framework linking the landscape of fear, defined as spatial variation in prey perception of risk, to the underlying physical landscape and predation risk, and to resulting patterns of prey distribution and antipredator behavior. By disambiguating the mechanisms through which prey perceive risk and incorporate fear into decision making, we can better quantify the nonlinear relationship between risk and response and evaluate the relative importance of the landscape of fear across taxa and ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Earth harbours an extraordinary plant phenotypic diversity1 that is at risk from ongoing global changes2,3. However, it remains unknown how increasing aridity and livestock grazing pressure---two major drivers of global change4--6---shape the trait covariation that underlies plant phenotypic diversity1,7. Here we assessed how covariation among 20 chemical and morphological traits responds to aridity and grazing pressure within global drylands. Our analysis involved 133,769 trait measurements spanning 1,347 observations of 301 perennial plant species surveyed across 326 plots from 6 continents. Crossing an aridity threshold of approximately 0.7 (close to the transition between semi-arid and arid zones) led to an unexpected 88\% increase in trait diversity. This threshold appeared in the presence of grazers, and moved toward lower aridity levels with increasing grazing pressure. Moreover, 57\% of observed trait diversity occurred only in the most arid and grazed drylands, highlighting the phenotypic uniqueness of these extreme environments. Our work indicates that drylands act as a global reservoir of plant phenotypic diversity and challenge the pervasive view that harsh environmental conditions reduce plant trait diversity8--10. They also highlight that many alternative strategies may enable plants to cope with increases in environmental stress induced by climate change and land-use intensification.},

  abstract = {Soils are the foundation of all terrestrial ecosystems1. However, unlike for plants and animals, a global assessment of hotspots for soil nature conservation is still lacking2. This hampers our ability to establish nature~conservation priorities for the multiple dimensions that support the soil system: from soil biodiversity to ecosystem services. Here, to identify global hotspots for soil nature conservation, we performed a global field survey that includes observations of biodiversity (archaea, bacteria, fungi, protists and invertebrates) and functions (critical for six ecosystem services) in 615 composite samples of topsoil from a standardized survey in all continents. We found that each of the different ecological dimensions of soils---that is, species richness (alpha diversity, measured as amplicon sequence variants), community dissimilarity and ecosystem services---peaked in contrasting regions of the planet, and were associated with different environmental factors. Temperate ecosystems showed the highest species richness, whereas community dissimilarity peaked in the tropics, and colder high-latitudinal ecosystems were identified as hotspots of ecosystem services. These findings highlight the complexities that are involved in simultaneously protecting multiple ecological dimensions of soil. We further show that most of these hotspots are not adequately covered by protected areas (more than 70\%), and are vulnerable in the context of several scenarios of global change. Our global estimation of priorities for soil nature conservation highlights the importance of accounting for the multidimensionality of soil biodiversity and ecosystem services to conserve soils for future generations.},

  abstract = {Climate change is a world-wide threat to biodiversity and ecosystem structure, functioning and services. To understand the underlying drivers and mechanisms, and to predict the consequences for nature and people, we urgently need better understanding of the direction and magnitude of climate change impacts across the soil--plant--atmosphere continuum. An increasing number of climate change studies are creating new opportunities for meaningful and high-quality generalizations and improved process understanding. However, significant challenges exist related to data availability and/or compatibility across studies, compromising opportunities for data re-use, synthesis and upscaling. Many of these challenges relate to a lack of an established `best practice' for measuring key impacts and responses. This restrains our current understanding of complex processes and mechanisms in terrestrial ecosystems related to climate change. To overcome these challenges, we collected best-practice methods emerging from major ecological research networks and experiments, as synthesized by 115 experts from across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Our handbook contains guidance on the selection of response variables for different purposes, protocols for standardized measurements of 66 such response variables and advice on data management. Specifically, we recommend a minimum subset of variables that should be collected in all climate change studies to allow data re-use and synthesis, and give guidance on additional variables critical for different types of synthesis and upscaling. The goal of this community effort is to facilitate awareness of the importance and broader application of standardized methods to promote data re-use, availability, compatibility and transparency. We envision improved research practices that will increase returns on investments in individual research projects, facilitate second-order research outputs and create opportunities for collaboration across scientific communities. Ultimately, this should significantly improve the quality and impact of the science, which is required to fulfil society's needs in a changing world.},

An increasing number of climate change studies are creating new opportunities for meaningful and high-quality generalizations and improved process understanding. However, significant challenges exist related to data availability and/or compatibility across studies, compromising opportunities for data re-use, synthesis and upscaling. Many of these challenges relate to a lack of an established `best practice' for measuring key impacts and responses. This restrains our current understanding of complex processes and mechanisms in terrestrial ecosystems related to climate change. To overcome these challenges, we collected best-practice methods emerging from major ecological research networks and experiments, as synthesized by 115 experts from across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Our handbook contains guidance on the selection of response variables for different purposes, protocols for standardized measurements of 66 such response variables and advice on data management. Specifically, we recommend a minimum subset of variables that should be collected in all climate change studies to allow data re-use and synthesis, and give guidance on additional variables critical for different types of synthesis and upscaling. The goal of this community effort is to facilitate awareness of the importance and broader application of standardized methods to promote data re-use, availability, compatibility and transparency. We envision improved research practices that will increase returns on investments in individual research projects, facilitate second-order research outputs and create opportunities for collaboration across scientific communities. Ultimately, this should significantly improve the quality and impact of the science, which is required to fulfil society's needs in a changing world.},

Trait-based approaches can support understanding of vegetation responses to global change drivers and consequences for ecosystem functioning. In six sites along a 1314\,m elevational gradient in Puna grasslands in the Peruvian Andes, we collected datasets on vascular plant composition, plant functional traits, biomass, ecosystem fluxes, and climate data over three years. The data were collected in the wet and dry season and from plots with different fire histories. We selected traits associated with plant resource use, growth, and life history strategies (leaf area, leaf dry/wet mass, leaf thickness, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf C, N, P content, C and N isotopes). The trait dataset contains 3,665 plant records from 145 taxa, 54,036 trait measurements (increasing the trait data coverage of the regional flora by 420\%) covering 14 traits and 121 plant taxa (ca. 40\% of which have no previous publicly available trait data) across 33 families.},

  abstract = {The trait composition and trait diversity of plant communities are globally applicable predictors of ecosystem functioning. Yet, it is unclear how plant traits influence carbon cycling. This is an important question in the tundra where vegetation shifts are occurring across the entire biome, and where soil organic carbon stocks are large and vulnerable to environmental change. To study how plant traits affect carbon cycling in the tundra, we built a model that explained carbon cycling (above-ground and soil organic carbon stocks, and photosynthetic and respiratory fluxes) with abiotic conditions (air temperature and soil moisture), and the averages and within-community variabilities of three above-ground traits: plant height, leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and SLA. These functional parameters were represented by abundance-weighted means and standard deviations of species traits. The data were collected from an observational study setting from northern Finland. The explanatory power of the models was relatively high, but a large part of variation in soil organic carbon stocks remained unexplained. Average plant height was the strongest predictor of all carbon cycling variables except soil carbon stocks. Communities of larger plants were associated with larger CO2 fluxes and above-ground carbon stocks. Communities with fast leaf economics (i.e. high SLA and low LDMC) had higher photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration and soil organic carbon stocks. Within-community variability in plant height, SLA and LDMC affected ecosystem functions differently. Variability in SLA and LDMC increased CO2 fluxes and soil organic carbon stocks, while variability in height increased the above-ground carbon stock. The contributions of within-community trait variability metrics to ecosystem functioning within the study area were about as important as those of average SLA and LDMC. Synthesis. Plant height, SLA and LDMC have clear effects on tundra carbon cycling. The importance of within-community trait variability highlights a potentially important mechanism controlling the vast tundra carbon pools that should be better recognized. More research on root traits and decomposer communities is needed to understand the below-ground mechanisms regulating carbon cycling in the tundra.},

In most locations, these changes in albedo offset or even negate the carbon removal benefits with the latter leading to global warming. Previous efforts to quantify the global climate mitigation benefit of restoring tree cover have not accounted robustly for albedo given a lack of spatially explicit data. Here we produce maps that show that carbon-only estimates may be up to 81\% too high. While dryland and boreal settings have especially severe albedo offsets, it is possible to find places that provide net-positive climate mitigation benefits in all biomes. We further find that on-the-ground projects are concentrated in these more climate-positive locations, but that the majority still face at least a 20\% albedo offset. Thus, strategically deploying restoration of tree cover for maximum climate benefit requires accounting for albedo change and we provide the tools to do so.},

Here, we applied a machine-learning approach to derive a global dataset of litter production by linking 2401 field observations and global environmental drivers. Results suggested that the observation-based estimate of global natural ecosystem litter production was 44.3 {\textpm} 0.4 Pg C year-1. By contrast, land-surface models (LSMs) overestimated the global litter production by about 27\%. With this new global litter production dataset, we estimated global {$\tau$}veg (mean value 10.3 {\textpm} 1.4 years) and its spatial distribution. Compared to our observation-based {$\tau$}veg, modelled {$\tau$}veg tended to underestimate {$\tau$}veg at high latitudes. Our empirically derived gridded datasets of litter production and {$\tau$}veg will help constrain global vegetation models and improve the prediction of global carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change will alter regional hydrologic cycles around the world, in part by increasing the frequency or duration of droughts in some areas. The International Drought Experiment (IDE) is investigating the impact of severe drought on terrestrial vegetation by experimentally reducing precipitation at dozens of sites. Here we implement the IDE precipitation reduction protocol using the Community Land Model (CLM). Though many model results suggest that carbon fertilization will outpace drought-caused reduction of terrestrial carbon uptake, uncertainty is large. We therefore configure CLM to consider carbon cycling impacts of reduced moisture availability without intertwining the effects of carbon fertilization or phenological changes. California hosts a number of IDE sites and a wide range of topography, climate, and biomes. CMIP5 predictions suggest 21st century California will experience droughts in excess of the 1000-year climatological record for both frequency and magnitude. CLM suggests that some regions, including much of Northern California, may experience a steeper decline in gross primary productivity (GPP) during 21st century severe droughts than during 20th century severe droughts. Vegetation in Northern California experiences virtually all of this GPP reduction during the dry season, with little wet season GPP reduction even during severe drought. Southern California vegetation experiences soil moisture GPP limitation at virtually all times, increasing substantially with drought severity. Southern California should experience a more pronounced shift in GPP seasonality and decline in magnitude relative to Northern California during droughts. Some parts of every vegetated continent see changes to drought response and seasonality similar to Southern California. Our CLM results provide drought impacts that forthcoming IDE field observations may test, can help to spatially upscale site-based IDE observations of drought impact, and provide CLM's prediction of reduced precipitation impacts per unit leaf area index.},

  abstract = {Aim Mechanistic general ecosystem models are used to explore fundamental ecological dynamics and to assess possible consequences of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on ecosystems. The Madingley model is a mechanistic general ecosystem model (GEM) that simulates a coherent global ecosystem, consisting of photo-autotrophic and heterotrophic life, based on fundamental ecological processes. The C++ implementation of the Madingley model delivers fast computational performance, but it (a) limits the userbase to researchers that are familiar with the intricacies of C++ programming, (b) has limited possibility to change model settings and provide model outputs required to address specific research questions, and (c) has limited reproducibility of simulation experiments. The aim of this paper is to present an R package of the Madingley model to aid with increasing the accessibility and flexibility of the model. Innovation The MadingleyR R package streamlines the installation procedure and supports all major operating systems. MadingleyR enables users to combine multiple consecutive simulations, making case study specific modifications to MadingleyR objects along the way. Default input files are available from the package and study-specific inputs can be easily loaded from the R environment. MadingleyR also provides functions to plot and summarize MadingleyR outputs. We provide a comprehensive description of the MadingleyR functions and workflow. We also demonstrate the applicability of the MadingleyR package using three case studies: (a) simulating the cascading effects of the loss of mega-herbivores on food-web structure, (b) simulating the impacts of increased land-use intensity on the total biomass of different feeding guilds by restricting the total vegetation biomass available for feeding and (c) simulating the impacts of an intensive land-use scenario on a continental scale. Main conclusions The MadingleyR package provides direct accessibility to simulations with the mechanistic ecosystem model Madingley and is flexible in its application without a loss in performance.},

  abstract = {Resorption of key elements promotes their conservation in plants in nutrient-poor ecosystems. In seasonal environments, the timing of resorption is expected to influence resorption efficiency and plant fitness due to the trade-off between maximizing photosynthetic carbon gain by late resorption and minimizing frost risks and nutrient loss by early resorption. Here, we hypothesize that (1) these alternative strategies with respect to the timing of element resorption both occur among summergreen species; (2) deciduous woody plants favour delayed resorption while herbaceous species benefit from gradual, early onset resorption; (3) this pattern is part of a more general relationship in which species with conservative resource economic traits have more delayed resorption. We measured nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) contents of mature, senescing and senesced leaves of 22 predominant plant species across four types of ecosystems in a subarctic region. We then calculated timing of resorption as the Julian calendar day of 50\% of element resorption (T50), and examined its relationship with plant functional types and leaf resource economic traits (leaf mass per area [LMA], leaf C, N and P contents). The timing of N resorption in subarctic plants ranged from day 213 to 254, while the timing of P resorption ranged from day 211 to 261 and of C from day 214 to 260 across species. On average, the resorption of N and P and depletion of C were 13, 12 and 19 days respectively earlier in herbaceous plants than in woody ones. For all the three elements, T50 of plants decreased significantly with increasing acquisitive economic traits. Synthesis: As hypothesized, we found that (1) both ``steady-and-slow'' and ``late-and-fast'' strategies of resorption timing co-occurred in a subarctic flora; consistent with these two strategies, herbaceous plants resorbed nutrients and carbon earlier than deciduous woody species; (2) relevant functional traits representing resource conservation were positively and linearly related to the timing of nutrient resorption and carbon depletion. These findings for element resorption timing have important implications for functional changes in the vegetation composition of seasonal regions in response to temperature fluctuations in a changing climate.},

Several models have been suggested to account for this non linearity, the most recent being the Hutchinson--Mosier regression model (hmr). However, the practical application of these models is challenging because the researcher needs to decide for each flux whether a nonlinear fit is appropriate or exaggerates flux estimates due to measurement artifacts. In the latter case, a flux estimate from the linear model is a more robust solution and introduces less arbitrary uncertainty to the data. We present the new, dynamic and reproducible flux calculation scheme, kappa.max, for an improved trade-off between bias and uncertainty (i.e. accuracy and precision). We develop a tool to simulate, visualise and optimise the flux calculation scheme for any specific static N2O chamber measurement system. The decision procedure and visualisation tools are implemented in a package for the R software. Finally, we demonstrate with this approach the performance of the applied flux calculation scheme for a measured flux dataset to estimate the actual bias and uncertainty. The kappa.max method effectively improved the decision between linear and nonlinear flux estimates reducing the bias at a minimal cost of uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Most researchers agree that soil cover methods offer the most useful approach to measuring nitrous oxide (N2O) exchange in the field, but there is little uniformity in the design of covers used by them. The cover design least subject to the potential errors associated with this approach is a vented enclosure with either closed-loop air circulation or no forced air circulation. Although the soil N2O concentration gradient beneath these covers decreases with time as the gas accumulates, this problem can be overcome by a proposed change in the equation for computing flux from the increase in head-space N2O concentration. Over a broad range of sampling conditions, N2O fluxes computed from the new equation were independent of the time allowed for N2O accumulation. Other equations were developed that predict optimum soil cover vent dimensions for effectively transmitting ambient pressure fluctuations to the enclosed space while minimizing loss of the accumulating N2O by diffusion to the outside. Soil covers with vent dimensions dictated by the equations had N2O accumulation rates significantly higher than covers with 60\% smaller vent diameters but not significantly different than covers with 60\% larger vent diameters.},

  abstract = {Arid ecosystems, which occupy about 35\% of the Earth's terrestrial surface area, are believed to be among the most responsive to elevated [CO2]. Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was measured in the eighth year of CO2 enrichment at the Nevada Desert Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) Facility between the months of December 2003--December 2004. On most dates mean daily NEE (24 h) ({$\mu$}mol CO2 m-2 s-1) of ecosystems exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2 were similar to those maintained at current ambient CO2 levels. However, on sampling dates following rains, mean daily NEEs of ecosystems exposed to elevated [CO2] averaged 23 to 56\% lower than mean daily NEEs of ecosystems maintained at ambient [CO2]. Mean daily NEE varied seasonally across both CO2 treatments, increasing from about 0.1 {$\mu$}mol CO2 m-2 s-1 in December to a maximum of 0.5--0.6 {$\mu$}mol CO2 m-2 s-1 in early spring. Maximum NEE in ecosystems exposed to elevated CO2 occurred 1 month earlier than it did in ecosystems exposed to ambient CO2, with declines in both treatments to lowest seasonal levels by early October (0.09{\textpm}0.03 {$\mu$}mol CO2 m-2 s-1), but then increasing to near peak levels in late October (0.36{\textpm}0.08 {$\mu$}mol CO2 m-2 s-1), November (0.28{\textpm}0.03 {$\mu$}mol CO2 m-2 s-1), and December (0.54{\textpm}0.06 {$\mu$}mol CO2 m-2 s-1). Seasonal patterns of mean daily NEE primarily resulted from larger seasonal fluctuations in rates of daytime net ecosystem CO2 uptake which were closely tied to plant community phenology and precipitation. Photosynthesis in the autotrophic crust community (lichens, mosses, and free-living cyanobacteria) following rains were probably responsible for the high NEEs observed in January, February, and late October 2004 when vascular plant photosynthesis was low. Both CO2 treatments were net CO2 sinks in 2004, but exposure to elevated CO2 reduced CO2 sink strength by 30\% (positive net ecosystem productivity=127{\textpm}17 g C m-2 yr-1 ambient CO2 and 90{\textpm}11 g C m-2 yr-1 elevated CO2, P=0.011). This level of net C uptake rivals or exceeds levels observed in some forested and grassland ecosystems. Thus, the decrease in C sequestration seen in our study under elevated CO2-- along with the extensive coverage of arid and semi-arid ecosystems globally -- points to a significant drop in global C sequestration potential in the next several decades because of responses of heretofore overlooked dryland ecosystems.},

Previous studies have shown that the closure of non-steady-state chambers induces a non-linear concentration development inside the chamber, even across short chamber closure periods, and that both linear and non-linear flux estimates are impacted by the chamber closure period itself. Based on 3,159 individual soil CO2 and CH4 flux measurements, we analyzed how linear regression and Hutchinson and Mosier (1981) modeled flux estimates are affected by the length of the chamber closure period by increasing it in increments of 30 sec, with a minimum and maximum chamber closure period of 60 and 300 sec, respectively. Across all detected flux measurements, the effect of chamber closure period length varied between 1.4--8.0 \% for linear regression estimates and between 0.4--17.8 \% for Hutchinson--Mosier estimates, and the largest effect sizes were observed in high flux regions. While both linear regression and Hutchinson--Mosier based estimates decreased as the chamber closure period increased, we observed a clear convergence of flux estimates as shorter and longer chamber closure periods were used for linear regression and Hutchinson--Mosier based estimation, respectively. This suggests using closure periods as short as possible for linear regression flux estimation or ensuring long-enough closure periods to observe a stabilization of Hutchinson--Mosier flux estimates over time. This analysis was based on soil flux measurements, but because the perturbation of the concentration gradient is related to the non-steady-state chamber technique rather than the measured ecosystem component, our results have implications for all flux measurements conducted with non-steady-state chambers.},

Macroclimate control over this critical C flux facilitates the parametrization of the C cycle in Earth system models and the understanding of climate change effects on the global C balance. Yet, the long-standing paradigm of climate control was recently challenged by the so far underestimated environmental heterogeneity at local scales, questioning the conceptual framework of thousands of decomposition studies and accuracy of current predictive models. Using three complementary decomposition experiments at a European scale, we showed that macroclimate and litter characteristics largely control plant litter decomposition, reaffirming the role of macroclimate as an integrative decomposition driver through direct environmental control and by influencing co-evolving local plant and decomposer communities. Neglecting this latter indirect effect, commonly used standard litter types overrated micro-environmental control and failed to predict local decomposition of plot-specific litter. Our data help clarify a key question on the regulation of the global C cycle by identifying the relative role of control factors over decomposition and the scales at which they matter and by highlighting sources of confusion in the literature.},

Because soil microbes govern key biogeochemical processes, understanding their response to climate extremes is crucial in predicting the consequences for ecosystem functioning3,4. Here we subjected soils from 30\,grasslands across Europe to four contrasting extreme climatic events under common controlled conditions (drought, flood, freezing and heat), and compared the response of soil microbial communities and their functioning with those of undisturbed soils. Soil microbiomes exhibited a small, but highly consistent and phylogenetically conserved, response under the imposed extreme events. Heat treatment most strongly impacted soil microbiomes, enhancing dormancy and sporulation genes and decreasing metabolic versatility. Microbiome response to heat in particular could be predicted by local climatic conditions and soil properties, with soils that do not normally experience the extreme conditions being imposed being most vulnerable. Our results suggest that soil microbiomes from different climates share unified responses to extreme climatic events, but that predicting the extent of community change may require knowledge of the local microbiome. These findings advance our understanding of soil microbial responses to extreme events, and provide a first step for making general predictions about the impact of extreme climatic events on soil functioning.},

We also present evidence for herbivore responses to climate change and discuss how these responses may alter the spatial and temporal distribution of herbivore impacts. Several current knowledge gaps limit our understanding of the changing functional roles of herbivores; these include limited characterization of the spatial and temporal variability in herbivore impacts and of how herbivore activities influence the cycling of elements beyond carbon. We conclude by highlighting approaches that will promote better understanding of herbivore effects on tundra ecosystems, including their integration into existing biogeochemical models, new applications of remote sensing techniques, and the continued use of distributed experiments.},

  abstract = {Planting trees has become a popular solution for climate change mitigation, owing to the ability of trees to accumulate carbon in biomass and thereby reduce anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 enrichment. As conditions for tree growth expand with global warming, tree-planting projects have been introduced in regions of the highest northern latitudes. However, several lines of evidence suggest that high-latitude tree planting is counterproductive to climate change mitigation. In northern boreal and Arctic regions, tree planting results in net warming due to increased surface darkness (decreased albedo), which counteracts potential mitigation effects from carbon storage in areas where biomass is limited and of low resilience. Furthermore, tree planting disturbs pools of soil carbon, which store most of the carbon in cold ecosystems, and has negative effects on native Arctic biota and livelihoods. Despite the immediate economic prospects that northern tree planting may represent, this approach does not constitute a valid climate-warming-mitigation strategy in either the Arctic or most of the boreal forest region. This has been known for decades, but as policies that incentivize tree planting are increasingly adopted across the high-latitude region, we warn against a narrow focus on biomass carbon storage. Instead, we call for a systems-oriented consideration of climate solutions that are rooted in an understanding of the whole suite of relevant Earth system processes that affect the radiative balance. This is crucial to avoid the implementation of ineffective or even counterproductive climate-warming mitigation strategies in the Arctic and boreal regions.},

  abstract = {Closed (non-steady state) chambers are widely used for quantifying carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between soils or low-stature canopies and the atmosphere. It is well recognised that covering a soil or vegetation by a closed chamber inherently disturbs the natural CO2 fluxes by altering the concentration gradients between the soil, the vegetation and the overlying air. Thus, the driving factors of CO2 fluxes are not constant during the closed chamber experiment, and no linear increase or decrease of CO2 concentration over time within the chamber headspace can be expected. Nevertheless, linear regression has been applied for calculating CO2 fluxes in many recent, partly influential, studies. This approach has been justified by keeping the closure time short and assuming the concentration change over time to be in the linear range. Here, we test if the application of linear regression is really appropriate for estimating CO2 fluxes using closed chambers over short closure times and if the application of nonlinear regression is necessary. We developed a nonlinear exponential regression model from diffusion and photosynthesis theory. This exponential model was tested with four different datasets of CO2 flux measurements (total number: 1764) conducted at three peatlands sites in Finland and a tundra site in Siberia. Thorough analyses of residuals demonstrated that linear regression was frequently not appropriate for the determination of CO2 fluxes by closed-chamber methods, even if closure times were kept short. The developed exponential model was well suited for nonlinear regression of the concentration over time c(t) evolution in the chamber headspace and estimation of the initial CO2 fluxes at closure time for the majority of experiments. However, a rather large percentage of the exponential regression functions showed curvatures not consistent with the theoretical model which is considered to be caused by violations of the underlying model assumptions. Especially the effects of turbulence and pressure disturbances by the chamber deployment are suspected to have caused unexplainable curvatures. CO2 flux estimates by linear regression can be as low as 40\% of the flux estimates of exponential regression for closure times of only two minutes. The degree of underestimation increased with increasing CO2 flux strength and was dependent on soil and vegetation conditions which can disturb not only the quantitative but also the qualitative evaluation of CO2 flux dynamics. The underestimation effect by linear regression was observed to be different for CO2 uptake and release situations which can lead to stronger bias in the daily, seasonal and annual CO2 balances than in the individual fluxes. To avoid serious bias of CO2 flux estimates based on closed chamber experiments, we suggest further tests using published datasets and recommend the use of nonlinear regression models for future closed chamber studies.},

  abstract = {The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas Kuhn has influenced scientists for decades. It focuses on a progression of science involving periodic, fundamental shifts---revolutions---from one existing paradigm to another. Embedded in this theory is the concept of normal science, that is, scientists work within the confines of established theory, a process often compared to a type of puzzle-solving. This Kuhnian aspect of scientific research has received little attention relative to the much-scrutinized concepts of revolutions and paradigms. We use Kuhn's normal science framework to reflect on the way ecologists practice science. This involves a discussion of how theory dependence influences each step of the scientific method, specifically, how past experiences and existing research frameworks guide the way ecologists acquire knowledge. We illustrate these concepts with ecological examples, including food web structure and the biodiversity crisis, emphasizing that the way one views the world influences how that person engages in scientific research. We conclude with a discussion of how Kuhnian ideas inform ecological research at practical levels, such as influences on grant funding allocation, and we make a renewed call for the inclusion of philosophical foundations of ecological principles in pedagogy. By studying the processes and traditions of how science is carried out, ecologists can better direct scientific insight to address the world's most pressing environmental problems.},

  abstract = {The Himalayan alpine zone (HAZ)---a high-altitude zone above approximately 4,100 m.a.s.l., is projected to experience strong eco-environmental changes with climate change. As plants expand their range in this region, other processes are likely to be impacted; for example, flows and stores of water. A first vital step in conceptualizing HAZ ecohydrology is to understand the distribution pattern of HAZ vegetation communities. Satellite remote sensing provides one means of doing so, but the often patchy distribution of alpine vegetation creates challenges when using coarse-grained satellite data whose pixels are typically coarser than the grain of vegetation pattern. Here we use fine spatial resolution satellite imagery from WorldView-2 (2 m2 per pixel) coupled with elevation model data from the Copernicus GLO-30 product to produce a land cover classification for the HAZ. Field data captured during in situ surveys in the Gokyo valley, Nepal, were used to drive and then test a random forest classifier. Grassy meadows and dwarf shrubs belonging to the Rhododendron and Juniperus families dominate the ecology of the alpine zone in this region, so we created three vegetation classes for mapping indicative major plant communities dominated by these species. We found that altitude and aspect were dominant drivers of vegetation distribution in the HAZ and that the average vegetation cover of Rhododendron spp. and Juniperus spp. reduces with increasing altitude, as expected. South- and east-facing slopes were dominated by Juniperus spp., whereas north- and west-facing slopes were dominated by Rhododendron spp., and the growth extent of Rhododendron spp. (between 4,010 and 4,820 m.a.s.l.) and meadow (between 4,010 and 4,680 m.a.s.l.) were vertically wider than that of Juniperus spp. (between 4,010 and 4,660 m.a.s.l.). Results from this study demonstrate the vegetation distribution pattern in HAZ at the plant community level and provide an impetus for further studies that seek to understand ecohydrological interactions between dwarf plants and water flows and stores in the HAZ.},

Here we address this gap using a comprehensive dataset describing the supply of 16 cultural, regulating and provisioning ecosystem services in 150 European agricultural grassland plots, and detailed multi-scale data on land use and plant diversity. After controlling for land-use and abiotic factors, we show that both plot-level and surrounding plant diversity play an important role in the supply of cultural and aboveground regulating ecosystem services. In contrast, provisioning and belowground regulating ecosystem services are more strongly driven by field-level management and abiotic factors. Structural equation models revealed that surrounding plant diversity promotes ecosystem services both directly, probably by fostering the spill-over of ecosystem service providers from surrounding areas, and indirectly, by maintaining plot-level diversity. By influencing the ecosystem services that local stakeholders prioritized, biodiversity at different scales was also shown to positively influence a wide range of stakeholder groups. These results provide a comprehensive picture of which ecosystem services rely most strongly on biodiversity, and the respective scales of biodiversity that drive these services. This key information is required for the upscaling of biodiversity--ecosystem service relationships, and the informed management of biodiversity within agricultural landscapes.},

  abstract = {Shrubland ecosystems across Europe face a range of threats including the potential impacts of climate change. Within the INCREASE project, six shrubland ecosystems along a European climatic gradient were exposed to ecosystem-level year-round experimental nighttime warming and long-term, repeated growing season droughts. We quantified the ecosystem level CO2 fluxes, i.e. gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Reco) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE), in control and treatment plots and compared the treatment effects along the Gaussen aridity index. In general, GPP exhibited higher sensitivity to drought and warming than Reco and was found to be the dominant contributor to changes in overall NEE. Across the climate gradient, northern sites were more likely to have neutral to positive responses of NEE, i.e. increased CO2 uptake, to drought and warming partly due to seasonal rewetting. While an earlier investigation across the same sites showed a good cross-site relationship between soil respiration responses to climate over the Gaussen aridity index, the responses of GPP, Reco and NEE showed a more complex response pattern suggesting that site-specific ecosystem traits, such as different growing season periods and plant species composition, affected the overall response pattern of the ecosystem-level CO2 fluxes. We found that the observed response patterns of GPP and Reco rates at the six sites could be explained well by the hypothesized position of each site on site-specific soil moisture response curves of GPP/Reco fluxes. Such relatively simple, site-specific analyses could help improve our ability to explain observed CO2 flux patterns in larger meta-analyses as well as in larger-scale model upscaling exercises and thereby help improve our ability to project changes in ecosystem CO2 fluxes in response to future climate change.},

Variations in the albedo can affect the surface radiation budget and further impact the global climate. In this study, the interannual variation of albedo from 2002 to 2016 was estimated on the global scale using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets. The presence and causes of the albedo changes for each specific region were also explored. From 2002 to 2016, the MODIS-based albedo decreased globally, snow cover declined by 0.970 (percent per pixel), while the seasonally integrated normalized difference vegetation index increased by 0.175. Some obvious increases in the albedo were detected in Central Asia, northeastern China, parts of the boreal forest in Canada, and the temperate steppe in North America. In contrast, noticeable decreases in the albedo were found in the Siberian tundra, Europe, southeastern Australia, and northeastern regions of North America. In the Northern Hemisphere, the greening trend at high latitudes made more contribution to the decline in the albedo. However, the dramatic fluctuation of snow-cover at midlatitudes predominated in the change of albedo. Our analysis can help to understand the roles that vegetation and snow cover play in the variation of albedo on global and regional scales.},

The maintenance mechanism of ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) relationship between different dimensions of biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality in alpine meadows on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau was still unclear. This paper investigates the elevation patterns of species, functions, and phylogenetic diversity of plant communities in alpine meadows on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and their effects on EMF using factor analysis and the radial basis function (RBF) neural network model. The results showed that (1) the species and phylogenetic diversity indices (except MPD index) increased and then decreased with elevation; the functional diversity indices FRic and FEve showed a decreasing trend with elevation, while FDiv showed the opposite. (2) Ecosystem multifunctional indices for the five elevation gradients were 3000~m~{$>~$}3250~m~{$>~$}3500~m~{$>~$}3750~m~{$>~$}4000~m. There were significant correlations between biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Species richness, Simpson, FRic, and FDiv increased with increasing EMF, but the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and EMF was insignificant. (3) Among the biodiversity indices, species richness and functional richness indices had a greater impact on EMF and were also important drivers to explain changes in EMF, followed by PD indices. The high biodiversity of alpine meadows can contribute to the supply of multifunctional ecosystems, making them healthier and more stable.},

  abstract = {Soil respiration (Rs), as the second largest flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, is vulnerable to global nitrogen (N) enrichment. However, the global distribution of the N effects on Rs remains uncertain. Here, we compiled a new database containing 1282 observations of Rs and its heterotrophic component (Rh) in field N manipulative experiments from 317 published papers. Using this up-to-date database, we first performed a formal meta-analysis to explore the responses of Rs and Rh to N addition, and then presented a global spatially explicit quantification of the N effects using a Random Forest model. Our results showed that experimental N addition significantly increased Rs but had a minimal impact on Rh, not supporting the prevailing view that N enrichment inhibits soil microbial respiration. For the major biomes, the magnitude of N input was the main determinant of the spatial variation in Rs response, while the most important predictors for Rh response were biome specific. Based on the key predictors, global mapping visually demonstrated a positive N effect in the regions with higher anthropogenic N inputs (i.e., atmospheric N deposition and agricultural fertilization). Overall, our analysis not only provides novel insight into the N effects on soil CO2 fluxes, but also presents a spatially explicit assessment of the N effects at the global scale, which are pivotal for understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics in future scenarios with more frequent anthropogenic activities.},

  abstract = {The climate sensitivity of carbon (C) cycling in Arctic terrestrial ecosystems is a major unknown in the Earth system. There is a lack of knowledge about the mechanisms that drive the interactions between photosynthesis, respiration, and changes in C stocks across full annual cycles in Arctic tundra. We use a calibrated and validated model (soil-plant-atmosphere; SPA) to estimate net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Reco), and internal C processing across eight full years. SPA's carbon flux estimates are validated with observational data obtained from the Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring program in West Greenland tundra. Overall, the model explained 73\%, 73\%, and 50\% of the variance in NEE, GPP, and Reco, respectively, and 85\% of the plant greenness variation. Flux data highlighted the insensitivity of growing season NEE to interannual meteorological variability, due to compensatory responses of photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration. In this modelling study, we show that this NEE buffering is the case also for full annual cycles. We show through a sensitivity analysis that plant traits related to nitrogen are likely key determinants in the compensatory response, through simulated links to photosynthesis and plant respiration. Interestingly, we found a similar temperature sensitivity of the trait-flux couplings for GPP and Reco, suggesting that plant traits drive the stabilization of NEE. Further, model analysis indicated that wintertime periods decreased the C sink by 60\%, mostly driven by litter heterotrophic respiration. This result emphasizes the importance of wintertime periods and allows a more comprehensive understanding of full annual C dynamics.},

Here we remind researchers of the need for careful evaluation of database records prior to use in modelling, especially when the presence of cryptic species is suspected or many records are based on indirect evidence. To draw attention to this potential problem, we construct ENMs for the North American Sasquatch (i.e. Bigfoot). Specifically, we use a large database of georeferenced putative sightings and footprints for Sasquatch in western North America, demonstrating how convincing environmentally predicted distributions of a taxon's potential range can be generated from questionable site-occurrence data. We compare the distribution of Bigfoot with an ENM for the black bear, Ursus americanus, and suggest that many sightings of this cryptozoid may be cases of mistaken identity.},

  abstract = {Natural climate solutions (NCS) in the Arctic hold the potential to be implemented at a scale able to substantially affect the global climate. The strong feedbacks between carbon-rich permafrost, climate and herbivory suggest an NCS consisting of reverting the current wet/moist moss and shrub-dominated tundra and the sparse forest--tundra ecotone to grassland through a guild of large herbivores. Grassland-dominated systems might delay permafrost thaw and reduce carbon emissions---especially in Yedoma regions, while increasing carbon capture through increased productivity and grass and forb deep root systems. Here we review the environmental context of megafaunal ecological engineering in the Arctic; explore the mechanisms through which it can help mitigate climate change; and estimate its potential---based on bison and horse, with the aim of evaluating the feasibility of generating an ecosystem shift that is economically viable in terms of carbon benefits and of sufficient scale to play a significant role in global climate change mitigation. Assuming a megafaunal-driven ecosystem shift we find support for a megafauna-based arctic NCS yielding substantial income in carbon markets. However, scaling up such projects to have a significant effect on the global climate is challenging given the large number of animals required over a short period of time. A first-cut business plan is presented based on practical information---costs and infrastructure---from Pleistocene Park (northeastern Yakutia, Russia). A 10 yr experimental phase incorporating three separate introductions of herds of approximately 1000 individuals each is costed at US\$114 million, with potential returns of approximately 0.3--0.4\% yr-1 towards the end of the period, and greater than 1\% yr-1 after it.

  abstract = {Many organisms live in environments in which temperatures differ substantially from those measured by standard weather stations. The last decade has witnessed a paradigm shift in efforts to quantify these differences and to understand their ecological, functional and evolutionary implications. This renewed interest in microclimate ecology has been accompanied by the development of various compact temperature sensors and radiation shields. However, it is clear that there are many pitfalls when measuring temperature using these devices. Here we address the problem of measuring temperatures in these microenvironments accurately. We first discuss the theory of measuring surface, ground and air temperatures with reference to energy fluxes and how these are modified by material, reflective properties and size of the device. We highlight the particular difficulties associated with measuring air temperature. We then report on the results of a series of experiments in which air temperatures recorded by various commonly used microclimate temperature loggers are compared to those obtained using research-grade instruments and synoptic weather stations. While accurate measurements of surface and ground temperatures and air temperatures at night and in shaded environments can be relatively easily obtained, we show substantial errors are to be expected when measuring air temperatures in environments exposed to sunlight. Most standard sensors yield large errors, which can reach 25{$^\circ$}C due to radiative fluxes operating on the thermometer. This problem cannot be wholly overcome by shielding the thermometer from sunlight, as the shield itself will influence both the temperatures being measured and the accuracy of measurement. We demonstrate that reasonably accurate estimates of air temperature can be obtained with low-cost and unshielded ultrafine-wire thermocouples that possess low thermal emissivity and a highly reflective surface. As the processes that create microclimatic temperature variation are the same as those that cause errors, other logger types should be used with care, and generally avoided in environments exposed to sunlight and close to the ground where wind speeds are lower. We urge researchers interested in microclimates and their effects to pay greater heed to the physics of heat exchange when attempting to measure microclimate temperatures and to understand the trade-offs that exist in doing so.},

  abstract = {Arctic and alpine tundra ecosystems are large reservoirs of organic carbon1,2. Climate warming may stimulate ecosystem respiration and release carbon into the atmosphere3,4. The magnitude and persistency of this stimulation and the environmental mechanisms that drive its variation remain uncertain5--7. This hampers the accuracy of global land carbon--climate feedback projections7,8. Here we synthesize 136 datasets from 56 open-top chamber in situ warming experiments located at 28 arctic and alpine tundra sites which have been running for less than 1\,year up to 25\,years. We show that a mean rise of 1.4\,{$^\circ$}C [confidence interval (CI) 0.9--2.0\,{$^\circ$}C] in air and 0.4\,{$^\circ$}C [CI 0.2--0.7\,{$^\circ$}C] in soil temperature results in an increase in growing season ecosystem respiration by 30\% [CI 22--38\%] (n\,=\,136). Our findings indicate that the stimulation of ecosystem respiration was due to increases in both plant-related and microbial respiration (n\,=\,9) and continued for at least 25\,years (n\,=\,136). The magnitude of the warming effects on respiration was driven by variation in warming-induced changes in local soil conditions, that is, changes in total nitrogen concentration and pH and by context-dependent spatial variation in these conditions, in particular total nitrogen concentration and the carbon:nitrogen ratio. Tundra sites with stronger nitrogen limitations and sites in which warming had stimulated plant and microbial nutrient turnover seemed particularly sensitive in their respiration response to warming. The results highlight the importance of local soil conditions and warming-induced changes therein for future climatic impacts on respiration.},

  abstract = {Arctic change is expected to destabilize terrestrial carbon (terrOC) in soils and permafrost, leading to fluvial release, greenhouse gas emission and climate feedback. However, landscape heterogeneity and location-specific observations complicate large-scale assessments of terrOC mobilization. Here we reveal differences in terrOC release, deduced from the Circum-Arctic Sediment Carbon Database (CASCADE) using source-diagnostic ({$\delta$}13C-{$\Delta$}14C) and carbon accumulation data. The results show five-times larger terrOC release from the Eurasian than from the American Arctic. Most of the circum-Arctic terrOC originates from near-surface soils (61\%); 30\% stems from Pleistocene-age permafrost. TerrOC translocation, relative to land-based terrOC stocks, varies by a factor of five between circum-Arctic regions. Shelf seas with higher relative terrOC translocation follow the spatial pattern of recent Arctic warming, while such with lower translocation reflect long-distance lateral transport with efficient remineralization of terrOC. This study provides a receptor-based perspective for how terrOC release varies across the circum-Arctic.},

During the same period of time humanity has doubled the amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. There has, however, been progress and some notable successes in the negotiations. In 2015, at COP21 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 196 countries adopted the Paris Agreement stating that they would limit global temperatures to well below 2{$^\circ$}C above pre-industrial levels and would pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5{$^\circ$}C above pre-industrial levels. The first review of the Paris Agreement was at COP26 in Glasgow with many countries pledging to go to net zero emissions by the middle of the century. But currently these pledges, if fulfilled, will only limit the global average temperature to between 2.4{$^\circ$}C and 2.8{$^\circ$}C. At COP27 in Egypt the core agreements from the Glasgow Climate Pact were maintained and countries finally agreed to set up a loss and damage facility -- although details of who will provide the finance and who can claim are still be to be worked out. This article reviews the key moments in the history of international climate change negotiations and discusses what the key objectives are for future COP meetings. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Climate warming has been suggested to impact high latitude grasslands severely, potentially causing considerable carbon (C) losses from soil. Warming can also stimulate nitrogen (N) turnover, but it is largely unclear whether and how altered N availability impacts belowground C dynamics. Even less is known about the individual and interactive effects of warming and N availability on the fate of recently photosynthesized C in soil. On a 10-year geothermal warming gradient in Iceland, we studied the effects of soil warming and N addition on CO2 fluxes and the fate of recently photosynthesized C through CO2 flux measurements and a 13CO2 pulse-labeling experiment. Under warming, ecosystem respiration exceeded maximum gross primary productivity, causing increased net CO2 emissions. N addition treatments revealed that, surprisingly, the plants in the warmed soil were N limited, which constrained primary productivity and decreased recently assimilated C in shoots and roots. In soil, microbes were increasingly C limited under warming and increased microbial uptake of recent C. Soil respiration was increased by warming and was fueled by increased belowground inputs and turnover of recently photosynthesized C. Our findings suggest that a decade of warming seemed to have induced a N limitation in plants and a C limitation by soil microbes. This caused a decrease in net ecosystem CO2 uptake and accelerated the respiratory release of photosynthesized C, which decreased the C sequestration potential of the grassland. Our study highlights the importance of belowground C allocation and C-N interactions in the C dynamics of subarctic ecosystems in a warmer world.},

  abstract = {A significant warming effect on arctic tundra is greening. Although this increase in predominantly woody vegetation has been linked to increases in gross primary productivity, increasing temperatures also stimulate ecosystem respiration. We present a novel analysis from small-scale plot measurements showing that the shape of the temperature- and light-dependent sink-to-source threshold (where net ecosystem exchange (NEE) equals zero) differs between two tussock tundra ecosystems differing in leaf area index (LAI). At the higher LAI site, the threshold is exceeded (i.e the ecosystem becomes a source) at relatively higher temperatures under low light but at lower temperatures under high light. At the lower LAI site, the threshold is exceeded at relatively lower temperatures under low light but at higher temperatures under high light. We confirmed this response at a single site where LAI was experimentally increased. This suggests the carbon balance of the tundra may be sensitive to small increases in temperature under low light, but that this effect may be significantly offset by increases in LAI. Importantly, we found that this LAI effect is reversed under high light, and so in a warming tundra, greater vegetation cover could have a progressively negative effect on net carbon uptake.},

  abstract = {Declines in grassland diversity in response to nutrient addition are a general consequence of global change. This decline in species richness may be driven by multiple underlying processes operating at different time-scales. Nutrient addition can reduce diversity by enhancing the rate of local extinction via competitive exclusion, or by reducing the rate of colonization by constraining the pool of species able to colonize under new conditions. Partitioning net change into extinction and colonization rates will better delineate the long-term effect of global change in grasslands. We synthesized changes in richness in response to experimental fertilization with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium with micronutrients across 30 grasslands. We quantified changes in local richness, colonization, and extinction over 8--10 years of nutrient addition, and compared these rates against control conditions to isolate the effect of nutrient addition from background dynamics. Total richness at steady state in the control plots was the sum of equal, relatively high rates of local colonization and extinction. On aggregate, 30\%--35\% of initial species were lost and the same proportion of new species were gained at least once over a decade. Absolute turnover increased with site-level richness but was proportionately greater at lower-richness sites relative to starting richness. Loss of total richness with nutrient addition, especially N in combination with P or K, was driven by enhanced rates of extinction with a smaller contribution from reduced colonization. Enhanced extinction and reduced colonization were disproportionately among native species, perennials, and forbs. Reduced colonization plateaued after the first few ({$<$}5) years after nutrient addition, while enhanced extinction continued throughout the first decade. Synthesis. Our results indicate a high rate of colonizations and extinctions underlying the richness of ambient communities and that nutrient enhancement drives overall declines in diversity primarily by exclusion of previously established species. Moreover, enhanced extinction continues over long time-scales, suggesting continuous, long-term community responses and a need for long-term study to fully realize the extinction impact of increased nutrients on grassland composition.},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of high-latitude surface energy budgets (SEBs) for land-climate interactions in the rapidly changing Arctic, uncertainties in their prediction persist. Here, we harmonize SEB observations across a network of vegetated and glaciated sites at circumpolar scale (1994--2021). Our variance-partitioning analysis identifies vegetation type as an important predictor for SEB-components during Arctic summer (June-August), compared to other SEB-drivers including climate, latitude and permafrost characteristics. Differences among vegetation types can be of similar magnitude as between vegetation and glacier surfaces and are especially high for summer sensible and latent heat fluxes. The timing of SEB-flux summer-regimes (when daily mean values exceed 0 Wm-2) relative to snow-free and -onset dates varies substantially depending on vegetation type, implying vegetation controls on snow-cover and SEB-flux seasonality. Our results indicate complex shifts in surface energy fluxes with land-cover transitions and a lengthening summer season, and highlight the potential for improving future Earth system models via a refined representation of Arctic vegetation types.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses enable synthesis of results from globally distributed experiments to draw general conclusions about the impacts of global change factors on ecosystem function. Traditional meta-analyses, however, are challenged by the complexity and diversity of experimental results. We illustrate how several key issues can be addressed by a multivariate, hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis (MHBM) approach applied to information extracted from published studies. We applied an MHBM to log-response ratios for aboveground biomass (AB, n = 300), belowground biomass (BB, n = 205) and soil CO2 exchange (SCE, n = 544), representing 100 studies. The MHBM accounted for study duration, climate effects and covariation among the AB, BB and SCE responses to elevated CO2 (eCO2) and/or warming. The MHBM revealed significant among-study covariation in the AB and BB responses to experimental treatments. The MHBM imputed missing duration (4.2\%) and climate (6\%) data, and revealed that climate context governs how eCO2 and warming impact ecosystem function. Predictions identified biomes that may be particularly sensitive to eCO2 or warming, but that are under-represented in global change experiments. The MHBM approach offers a flexible and powerful tool for synthesising disparate experimental results reported across multiple studies, sites and response variables.},

  abstract = {We present a method and software for reconstructing palaeoclimate from pollen data with a focus on accounting for and reducing uncertainty. The tools we use include: forward models, which enable us to account for the data generating process and hence the complex relationship between pollen and climate; joint inference, which reduces uncertainty by borrowing strength between aspects of climate and slices of the core; and dynamic climate histories, which allow for a far richer gamut of inferential possibilities. Through a Monte Carlo approach we generate numerous equally probable joint climate histories, each of which is represented by a sequence of values of three climate dimensions in discrete time, i.e. a multivariate time series. All histories are consistent with the uncertainties in the forward model and the natural temporal variability in climate. Once generated, these histories can provide most probable climate estimates with uncertainty intervals. This is particularly important as attention moves to the dynamics of past climate changes. For example, such methods allow us to identify, with realistic uncertainty, the past century that exhibited the greatest warming. We illustrate our method with two data sets: Laguna de la Roya, with a radiocarbon dated chronology and hence timing uncertainty; and Lago Grande di Monticchio, which contains laminated sediment and extends back to the penultimate glacial stage. The procedure is made available via an open source R package, Bclim, for which we provide code and instructions.},

  abstract = {Plant functional traits play important roles in determining plant responses to environmental change and further shaping community composition, but the role of plant stoichiometry remains poorly understood in regulating community responses to continually increased nitrogen (N) deposition. In this paper, we used a 5-year manipulative experiment with six N addition rates (Nrate) to explore how the N response of different plant functional groups including forbs, grasses, sedges and legumes links to above-ground plant carbon-to-N ratio (C:N, related to N use strategies) in an alpine meadow. We found that plant C:N explained 45.8\% and 42.6\% of N response variation among functional groups in plant above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and abundance. Over increasing Nrate, functional groups with higher C:N (grasses and sedges) tended to grow better and have greater abundance, yet those with lower C:N (forbs and legumes) were at risk of loss, subsequently mitigating the N-caused decline in community-level plant C:N. This was mainly due to that functional groups with higher C:N not only possessed higher N use efficiency but also had greater competitiveness for above-ground light due to higher plant height. In addition, we also found that plant C:N differences among functional groups remained relatively constant over Nrate, suggesting that the ability of this trait to indicate functional group-specific N responses was stable. Synthesis. Our results show that the N responses of different herbaceous plants can be well explained by plant C:N. Thus, we suggest the prediction of plant community composition changes under N deposition would be greatly improved by considering this easily measured stoichiometric trait.},

  abstract = {AbstractQuantifying rates of climate change in mountain regions is of considerable interest, not least because mountains are viewed as climate ``hotspots'' where change can anticipate or amplify what is occurring elsewhere. Accelerating mountain climate change has extensive environmental impacts, including depletion of snow/ice reserves, critical for the world's water supply. Whilst the concept of elevation-dependent warming (EDW), whereby warming rates are stratified by elevation, is widely accepted, no consistent EDW profile at the global scale has been identified. Past assessments have also neglected elevation-dependent changes in precipitation. In this comprehensive analysis, both in situ station temperature and precipitation data from mountain regions, and global gridded data sets (observations, reanalyses, and model hindcasts) are employed to examine the elevation dependency of temperature and precipitation changes since 1900. In situ observations in paired studies (using adjacent stations) show a tendency toward enhanced warming at higher elevations. However, when all mountain/lowland studies are pooled into two groups, no systematic difference in high versus low elevation group warming rates is found. Precipitation changes based on station data are inconsistent with no systematic contrast between mountain and lowland precipitation trends. Gridded data sets (CRU, GISTEMP, GPCC, ERA5, and CMIP5) show increased warming rates at higher elevations in some regions, but on a global scale there is no universal amplification of warming in mountains. Increases in mountain precipitation are weaker than for low elevations worldwide, meaning reduced elevation-dependency of precipitation, especially in midlatitudes. Agreement on elevation-dependent changes between gridded data sets is weak for temperature but stronger for precipitation.},

The chambers underestimated the reference fluxes by on average 33\% by the linear flux calculation method (Rlin), whereas the chamber fluxes calculated by the exponential flux calculation method (Rexp) did not significantly differ from the reference fluxes (p{$<$}0.05). The flux under- or overestimations were chamber specific and independent of flux level. Increasing chamber height, area and volume significantly reduced the flux underestimation (p{$<$}0.05). Also, the use of non-linear flux calculation method significantly improved the flux estimation; however, simultaneously the uncertainty in the fluxes was increased. We provide correction factors, which can be used to correct the under- or overestimation of the fluxes by the chambers in the experiment.},

  abstract = {Twenty chambers for measurement of soil CO2 efflux were compared against known CO2 fluxes ranging from 0.32 to 10.01{$\mu$}molCO2m-2s-1 and generated by a specially developed calibration tank. Chambers were tested on fine and coarse homogeneous quartz sand with particle sizes of 0.05--0.2 and 0.6mm, respectively. The effect of soil moisture on chamber measurements was tested by wetting the fine quartz sand to about 25\% volumetric water content. Non-steady-state through-flow chambers either underestimated or overestimated fluxes from -21 to +33\% depending on the type of chamber and the method of mixing air within the chamber's headspace. However, when results of all systems tested were averaged, fluxes were within 4\% of references. Non-steady-state non-through-flow chambers underestimated or overestimated fluxes from --35 to +6\%. On average, the underestimation was about 13--14\% on fine sand and 4\% on coarse sand. When the length of the measurement period was increased, the underestimation increased due to the rising concentration within the chamber headspace, which reduced the diffusion gradient within the soil. Steady-state through-flow chambers worked almost equally well in all sand types used in this study. They overestimated the fluxes on average by 2--4\%. Overall, the reliability of the chambers was not related to the measurement principle per se. Even the same chambers, with different collar designs, showed highly variable results. The mixing of air within the chamber can be a major source of error. Excessive turbulence inside the chamber can cause mass flow of CO2 from the soil into the chamber. The chamber headspace concentration also affects the flux by altering the concentration gradient between the soil and the chamber.},

I have two aims in this article First, I show how so-called Popperian ecologists have not only failed to use but have misused -- if not abused -- Popper in their criticisms of ecology. That is, the Popperian criticisms of ecology lack the justification the critics claim it has. Second, I claim that Popper's falsificationism is an unsuitable philosophy of science for ecology. In other words, ecology should not be criticized nor evaluated from the Popperian perspective in the first place.},

However, the impacts of shifting seasonal precipitation patterns on carbon (C) cycling and sequestration in dryland ecosystems remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a 10-yr (2013--2022) field manipulative experiment that altered the timing of growing-season precipitation peaks in a semi-arid grassland. We found that the delayed precipitation peak suppressed plant growth and thus reduced gross ecosystem productivity, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem productivity due to middle growing-season water stress. Surprisingly, shifting more precipitation to the early growing season can advance plant development, increase the dominance of drought-tolerant forbs, and thus compensate for the negative impacts of middle growing-season water stress on ecosystem C cycling, leading to a neutral change in grassland C sink. Our findings indicate that greater precipitation and plant development in spring could act as a crucial mechanism, maintaining plant growth and stabilizing ecosystem C sink. This underscores the urgent need to incorporate precipitation seasonality into Earth system models, which is crucial for improving projections of terrestrial C cycling and sequestration under future climate change scenarios.},

In this Review, we examine evidence for an enhanced land carbon sink and attribute the observed response to drivers and processes. This sink has doubled from 1.2\,{\textpm}\,0.5\,PgC\,yr-1 in the 1960s to 3.1\,{\textpm}\,0.6\,PgC\,yr-1 in the 2010s. This trend results largely from carbon dioxide fertilization increasing photosynthesis (driving an increase in the annual land carbon sink of {$>$}2\,PgC globally since 1900), mainly in tropical forest regions, and elevated temperatures reducing cold limitation, mainly at higher latitudes. Continued long-term land carbon sequestration is possible through the end of this century under multiple emissions scenarios, especially if nature-based climate solutions and appropriate ecosystem management are used. A new generation of globally distributed field experiments is needed to improve understanding of future carbon sink potential by measuring belowground carbon release, the response to carbon dioxide enrichment, and long-term shifts in carbon allocation and turnover.},

  abstract = {Climatic change is predicted to alter rates of soil respiration and assimilation of carbon by plants. Net loss of carbon from ecosystems would form a positive feedback enhancing anthropogenic global warming. We tested the effect of increased heat input, one of the most certain impacts of global warming, on net ecosystem carbon exchange in a Rocky Mountain montane meadow. Overhead heaters were used to increase the radiative heat flux into plots spanning a moisture and vegetation gradient. We measured net whole-ecosystem CO2 fluxes using a closed-path chamber system, relatively nondisturbing bases, and a simple model to compensate for both slow chamber leaks and the CO2 concentration-dependence of photosynthetic uptake, in 1993 and 1994. In 1994, we also measured soil respiration separately. The heating treatment altered the timing and magnitude of net carbon fluxes into the dry zone of the plots in 1993 (reducing uptake by {$\approx$}100 g carbon m--2), but had an undetectable effect on carbon fluxes into the moist zone. During a strong drought year (1994), heating altered the timing, but did not significantly alter the cumulative magnitude, of net carbon uptake in the dry zone. Soil respiration measurements showed that when differences were detected in dry zone carbon fluxes, they were caused by changes in carbon input from photosynthesis, not by temperature-driven changes in carbon output from soil respiration. When differences were detected in dry-zone carbon fluxes, they were caused by changes in carbon input from photosynthesis, not by a temperature-driven changes in carbon output from soil respiration. Regression analysis suggested that the reduction in carbon inputs from plants was due to a combination of two soil moisture effects: a direct physiological response to decreased soil moisture, and a shift in plant community composition from high-productivity species to low-productivity species that are more drought tolerant. These results partially support predictions that warming may cause net carbon losses from some terrestrial ecosystems. They also suggest, however, that changes in soil moisture caused by global warming may be as important in driving ecosystem response as the direct effects of increased soil temperature.},

  abstract = {Climatic change is predicted to alter rates of soil respiration and assimilation of carbon by plants. Net loss of carbon from ecosystems would form a positive feedback enhancing anthropogenic global warming. We tested the effect of increased heat input, one of the most certain impacts of global warming, on net ecosystem carbon exchange in a Rocky Mountain montane meadow. Overhead heaters were used to increase the radiative heat flux into plots spanning a moisture and vegetation gradient. We measured net whole-ecosystem CO2 fluxes using a closed-path chamber system, relatively nondisturbing bases, and a simple model to compensate for both slow chamber leaks and the CO2 concentration-dependence of photosynthetic uptake, in 1993 and 1994. In 1994, we also measured soil respiration separately. The heating treatment altered the timing and magnitude of net carbon fluxes into the dry zone of the plots in 1993 (reducing uptake by {$\approx$}100 g carbon m--2), but had an undetectable effect on carbon fluxes into the moist zone. During a strong drought year (1994), heating altered the timing, but did not significantly alter the cumulative magnitude, of net carbon uptake in the dry zone. Soil respiration measurements showed that when differences were detected in dry zone carbon fluxes, they were caused by changes in carbon input from photosynthesis, not by temperature-driven changes in carbon output from soil respiration. When differences were detected in dry-zone carbon fluxes, they were caused by changes in carbon input from photosynthesis, not by a temperature-driven changes in carbon output from soil respiration. Regression analysis suggested that the reduction in carbon inputs from plants was due to a combination of two soil moisture effects: a direct physiological response to decreased soil moisture, and a shift in plant community composition from high-productivity species to low-productivity species that are more drought tolerant. These results partially support predictions that warming may cause net carbon losses from some terrestrial ecosystems. They also suggest, however, that changes in soil moisture caused by global warming may be as important in driving ecosystem response as the direct effects of increased soil temperature.},

  abstract = {Fossil fuels and livestock grazing are often targeted as major culprits behind climate change and desertification. But Allan Savory, cofounder of the Savory Institute, begs to differ. The bigger problem, he warns, is our mismanagement of resources. Livestock grazing is not the problem; it's how we graze livestock. If we don't change the way we approach land management, irreparable harm from climate change could continue long after we replace fossil fuels with environmentally benign energy sources.  Holistic management is a systems-thinking approach for managing resources developed by Savory decades ago after observing the devastation of desertification in his native Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Properly managed livestock are key to restoring the world's grassland soils, the major sink for atmospheric carbon, and minimizing the most damaging impacts on humans and the natural world. This book updates Savory's paradigm-changing vision for reversing desertification, stemming the loss of biodiversity, eliminating fundamental causes of human impoverishment throughout the world, and climate change. Reorganized chapters make it easier for readers to understand the framework for Holistic Management and the four key insights that underlie it. New color photographs showcase before-and-after examples of land restored by livestock.  This long-anticipated new edition is written for new generations of ranchers, farmers, eco- and social entrepreneurs, and development professionals working to address global environmental and social degradation. It offers new hope that a sustainable future for humankind and the world we depend on is within reach.},

  abstract = {The carbon balance of high-latitude terrestrial ecosystems plays an essential role in the atmospheric concentration of trace gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Increasing atmospheric methane levels have contributed to {$\sim$} 20 \% of the observed global warming since the pre-industrial era. Rising temperatures in the Arctic are expected to promote the release of methane from Arctic ecosystems. Still, existing methane flux measurement efforts are sparse and highly scattered, and further attempts to assess the landscape fluxes over multiple years are needed.  Here we combine multi-year July--August methane flux monitoring (2006--2019) from automated flux chambers in the central fens of Zackenberg Valley, northeast Greenland, with several flux measurement campaigns on the most common vegetation types in the valley to estimate the landscape fluxes over 14 years. Methane fluxes based on manual chamber measurements are available from campaigns in 1997, 1999--2000, and in shorter periods from 2007--2013 and were summarized in several published studies. The landscape fluxes are calculated for the entire valley floor and a smaller subsection of the valley floor, containing the productive fen area, Rylek{\ae}rene.  When integrated for the valley floor, the estimated July--August landscape fluxes were low compared to the single previous estimate, while the landscape fluxes for Rylek{\ae}rene were comparable to previous estimates. The valley floor was a net methane source during July--August, with estimated mean methane fluxes ranging from 0.18 to 0.67 mg m-2 h-1. The mean methane fluxes in the fen-rich Rylek{\ae}rene were substantially higher, with fluxes ranging from 0.98 to 3.26 mg m-2 h-1.  A 2017--2018 erosion event indicates that some fen and grassland areas in the center of the valley are becoming unstable following pronounced fluvial erosion and a prolonged period of permafrost warming. Although such physical disturbance in the landscape can disrupt the current ecosystem--atmosphere flux patterns, even pronounced future erosion of ice-rich areas is unlikely to impact methane fluxes on a landscape scale significantly. Instead, projected changes in future climate in the valley play a more critical role. The results show that multi-year landscape methane fluxes are highly variable on a landscape scale and stress the need for long-term spatially distributed measurements in the Arctic.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Even though the Arctic is remote, aerosol properties observed there are strongly influenced by anthropogenic emissions from outside the Arctic. This is particularly true for the so-called Arctic haze season (January through April). In summer (June through September), when atmospheric transport patterns change, and precipitation is more frequent, local Arctic sources, i.e., natural sources of aerosols and precursors, play an important role. Over the last few decades, significant reductions in anthropogenic emissions have taken place. At the same time a large body of literature shows evidence that the Arctic is undergoing fundamental environmental changes due to climate forcing, leading to enhanced emissions by natural processes that may impact aerosol properties.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}In this study, we analyze 9 aerosol chemical species and 4 particle optical properties from 10 Arctic observatories (Alert, Kevo, Pallas, Summit, Thule, Tiksi, Barrow/Utqia{\.g}vik, Villum, and Gruvebadet and Zeppelin Observatory -- both at Ny-{\AA}lesund Research Station) to understand changes in anthropogenic and natural aerosol contributions.

Second, long-term trends are studied using the Mann--Kendall Theil--Sen slope method. We find in total 41 significant trends over full station records, i.e., spanning more than a decade, compared to 26 significant decadal trends. The majority of significantly declining trends is from anthropogenic tracers and occurred during the haze period, driven by emission changes between 1990 and 2000. For the summer period, no uniform picture of trends has emerged. Twenty-six percent of trends, i.e., 19 out of 73, are significant, and of those 5 are positive and 14 are negative. Negative trends include not only anthropogenic tracers such as equivalent black carbon at Kevo, but also natural indicators such as methanesulfonic acid and non-sea-salt calcium at Alert. Positive trends are observed for sulfate at Gruvebadet.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}No clear evidence of a significant change in the natural aerosol contribution can be observed yet. However, testing the sensitivity of the Mann--Kendall Theil--Sen method, we find that monotonic changes of around 5 \% yr\textsuperscript{-1} in an aerosol property are needed to detect a significant trend within one decade. This highlights that long-term efforts well beyond a decade are needed to capture smaller changes. It is particularly important to understand the ongoing natural changes in the Arctic, where interannual variability can be high, such as with forest fire emissions and their influence on the aerosol population.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}To investigate the climate-change-induced influence on the aerosol population and the resulting climate feedback, long-term observations of tracers more specific to natural sources are needed, as well as of particle microphysical properties such as size distributions, which can be used to identify changes in particle populations which are not well captured by mass-oriented methods such as bulk chemical composition.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {A crucial element in the ``the landscape of fear'' concept is that prey animals are aware of varying levels of predation risk at a spatial scale. This often leads to a negative spatial relationship between prey and predator in which prey avoid the most risky sites in the landscape. In this paper, we argue that our understanding of large carnivore-ungulate interactions is biased by studies from highly heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. the Yellowstone National Park). Due to a high availability of refuges and foraging sites in such landscapes, prey are able to reduce predation risk by showing habitat shifts. Besides the spatial heterogeneity at the landscape scale, the ungulate response to predation risk can be affected by the hunting mode (stalking vs. cursorial) of the predator. We propose that prey cannot easily avoid predation risk by moving to less risky habitats in more homogenous landscapes with concentrated food resources, especially where the large carnivores' assemblage includes both stalking and cursorial species. No distinct refuges for prey may occur in such landscapes due to equally high accessibility to predators in all habitats, while concentrated resources make prey distribution more predictable. We discuss a model of a densely forested landscape based on a case study of the Bia{\l}owie{\.z}a Primeval Forest, Poland. Within this landscape, ungulates focus their foraging activity on small food-rich forest gaps, which turn out to be ``death traps'' as the gaps are primarily targeted by predators (stalking lynx and cursorial wolf) while hunting. No alternative of moving to low predation risk areas exist for prey due to risk from wolves in surrounding closed-canopy forest. As a result, the prey is exposed to constant high predation pressure in contrast to heterogeneous landscapes with less concentrated resources and more refuge areas. Future research should focus on explaining how ungulates are coping with predation risk in these landscapes that offer little choice of escaping predation by considering behavioural and physiological (e.g. metabolic, hormonal) responses.},

We analysed multi-decadal time series containing 302 annual estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) flux across 70 permafrost and non-permafrost ecosystems, and 672 estimates of summer CO2 flux across 181 ecosystems. We find an increase in the annual CO2 sink across non-permafrost ecosystems but not permafrost ecosystems, despite similar increases in summer uptake. Thus, recent non-growing-season CO2 losses have substantially impacted the CO2 balance of permafrost ecosystems. Furthermore, analysis of interannual variability reveals warmer summers amplify the C cycle (increase productivity and respiration) at putatively nitrogen-limited sites and at sites less reliant on summer precipitation for water use. Our findings suggest that water and nutrient availability will be important predictors of the C-cycle response of these ecosystems to future warming.},

  abstract = {The closed static chamber technique is widely used to quantify greenhouse gases (GHG) i.e. CH4, CO2 and N2O from aquatic and wastewater treatment systems. However, chamber-measured fluxes over air--water interfaces appear to be subject to considerable uncertainty, depending on the chamber design, lack of air mixing in the chamber, concentration gradient changes during the deployment, and irregular eruptions of gas accumulated in the sediment. In this study, the closed static chamber technique was tested in an anaerobic pond operating under tropical conditions. The closed static chambers were found to be reliable to measure GHG, but an intrinsic limitation of using closed static chambers is that not all the data for gas concentrations measured within a chamber headspace can be used to estimate the flux due to gradient concentration curves with non-plausible and physical explanations. Based on the total data set, the percentage of curves accepted was 93.6, 87.2, and 73\% for CH4, CO2 and N2O, respectively. The statistical analyses demonstrated that only considering linear regression was inappropriate (i.e. approximately 40\% of the data for CH4, CO2 and N2O were best fitted to a non-linear regression) for the determination of GHG flux from stabilization ponds by the closed static chamber technique. In this work, it is clear that when R2adj-non-lin~{$>~$}R2adj-lin, the application of linear regression models is not recommended, as it leads to an underestimation of GHG fluxes by 10--50\%. This suggests that adopting only or mostly linear regression models will affect the GHG inventories obtained by using closed static chambers. According to our results, the misuse of the usual R2 parameter and only the linear regression model to estimate the fluxes will lead to reporting erroneous information on the real contribution of GHG emissions from wastewater. Therefore, the R2adj and non-linear regression model analysis should be used to reduce the biases in flux estimation by the inappropriate application of only linear regression models.},

  abstract = {Ecologists routinely use statistical models to detect and explain interactions among ecological drivers, with a goal to evaluate whether an effect of interest changes in sign or magnitude in different contexts. Two fundamental properties of interactions are often overlooked during the process of hypothesising, visualising and interpreting interactions between drivers: the measurement scale -- whether a response is analysed on an additive or multiplicative scale, such as a ratio or logarithmic scale; and the symmetry -- whether dependencies are considered in both directions. Overlooking these properties can lead to one or more of three inferential errors: misinterpretation of (i) the detection and magnitude (Type-D error), and (ii) the sign of effect modification (Type-S error); and (iii) misidentification of the underlying processes (Type-A error). We illustrate each of these errors with a broad range of ecological questions applied to empirical and simulated data sets. We demonstrate how meta-analysis, a widely used approach that seeks explicitly to characterise context dependence, is especially prone to all three errors. Based on these insights, we propose guidelines to improve hypothesis generation, testing, visualisation and interpretation of interactions in ecology.},

  abstract = {Plant communities experience impacts of increasing numbers of global change factors (e.g., warming, eutrophication, pollution). Consequently, unpredictable global change effects could arise. However, information about multi-factor effects on plant communities is scarce. To test plant-community responses to multiple global change factors (GCFs), we subjected sown and transplanted-seedling communities to increasing numbers (0, 1, 2, 4, 6) of co-acting GCFs, and assessed effects of individual factors and increasing numbers of GCFs on community composition and productivity. GCF number reduced species diversity and evenness of both community types, whereas none of the individual factors alone affected these measures. In contrast, GCF number positively affected the productivity of the transplanted-seedling community. Our findings show that simultaneously acting GCFs can affect plant communities in ways differing from those expected from single factor effects, which may be due to biological effects, sampling effects, or both. Consequently, exploring the multifactorial nature of global change is crucial to better understand ecological impacts of global change.},

  abstract = {Globally accelerating trends in societal development and human environmental impacts since the mid-twentieth century1--7 are known as the Great Acceleration and have been discussed as a key indicator of the onset of the Anthropocene~epoch6. While reports on ecological responses (for example, changes in species range or local extinctions) to the Great Acceleration are multiplying8, 9, it is unknown whether such biotic responses are undergoing a similar acceleration over time. This knowledge gap stems from the limited availability of time series data on biodiversity changes across large temporal and geographical extents. Here we use a dataset of repeated plant surveys from 302 mountain summits across Europe, spanning 145 years of observation, to assess the temporal trajectory of mountain biodiversity changes as a globally coherent imprint of the Anthropocene. We find a continent-wide acceleration in the rate of increase in plant species richness, with five times as much species enrichment between 2007 and 2016 as fifty years ago, between 1957 and 1966. This acceleration is strikingly synchronized with accelerated global warming and is not linked to alternative global change drivers. The accelerating increases in species richness on mountain summits across this broad spatial extent demonstrate that acceleration in climate-induced biotic change is occurring even in remote places on Earth, with potentially far-ranging consequences not only for biodiversity, but also for ecosystem functioning and services.},

  abstract = {The Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART was used to construct a global data set of 1.4 million continuous trajectories. At the model start, particles were distributed homogeneously in the atmosphere and were then transported for 5.5 years using both resolved winds from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses and parameterized turbulent and convective transport. On the basis of this data set, a climatology of transport in and to the Arctic was developed. It was found that the time air resides continuously north of 70{$^\circ$}N, called its Arctic age, is highest near the surface in the North American sector of the Arctic. North of 80{$^\circ$}N and near the surface, the mean Arctic age of air is about 1 week in winter and 2 weeks in summer. It decreases rapidly with altitude to about 3 days in the upper troposphere. In the most isolated regions of the Arctic, air is exposed to continuous darkness for, on average, 10--14 days in December. Transport from the stratosphere to the lower troposphere is much slower in the Arctic than in the middle latitudes. In the central Arctic, for instance, the probability that air near the surface was transported from the stratosphere within 10 days is only about 1\% in winter and 0.3\% in summer. Air pollution can be transported into the Arctic along three different pathways: low-level transport followed by ascent in the Arctic, low-level transport alone, and uplift outside the Arctic, followed by descent in the Arctic. Only this last pathway is frequent for pollution originating from North America and Asia, whereas European pollution can follow all three pathways in winter, and pathways one and three in summer. Sensitivities of Arctic air masses to emissions of air pollutants, based on transport alone, were calculated for times of up to 30 days before the air masses reached the Arctic. They were highest over Siberia and Europe in winter and over the oceans in summer. Using an inventory for anthropogenic black carbon (BC) emissions, it was found that near the surface and for transport timescales of 5 and 10 days, BC source contributions from south Asia are only 1.6\% and 10\%, respectively, of the corresponding European values, despite much higher emissions in south Asia. Using an inventory for BC emissions from forest fires, BC source contributions to the Arctic, particularly from fires in Siberia, were larger than anthropogenic BC source contributions in summer in years of average burning.},

  abstract = {Open Science (OS) comprises a variety of practices and principles that are broadly intended to improve the quality and transparency of research, and the concept is gaining traction. Since OS has multiple facets and still lacks a unifying definition, it may be interpreted quite differently among practitioners. Moreover, successfully implementing OS broadly throughout science requires a better understanding of the conditions that facilitate or hinder OS engagement, and in particular, how practitioners learn OS in the first place. We addressed these issues by surveying OS practitioners that attended a workshop hosted by the Living Norway Ecological Data Network in 2020. The survey contained scaled-response and open-ended questions, allowing for a mixed-methods approach. Out of 128 registered participants we obtained survey responses from 60 individuals. Responses indicated usage and sharing of data and code, as well as open access publications, as the OS aspects most frequently engaged with. Men and those affiliated with academic institutions reported more frequent engagement with OS than women and those with other affiliations. When it came to learning OS practices, only a minority of respondents reported having encountered OS in their own formal education. Consistent with this, a majority of respondents viewed OS as less important in their teaching than in their research and supervision. Even so, many of the respondents' suggestions for what would help or hinder individual OS engagement included more knowledge, guidelines, resource availability and social and structural support; indicating that formal instruction can facilitate individual OS engagement. We suggest that the time is ripe to incorporate OS in teaching and learning, as this can yield substantial benefits to OS practitioners, student learning, and ultimately, the objectives advanced by the OS movement.},

  abstract = {Soils store more carbon than other terrestrial ecosystems1,2. How soil organic carbon (SOC) forms and persists remains uncertain1,3, which makes it challenging to understand how it will respond to climatic change3,4. It has been suggested that soil microorganisms play an important role in SOC formation, preservation and loss5--7. Although microorganisms affect the accumulation and loss of soil organic matter through many pathways4,6,8--11, microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) is an integrative metric that can capture the balance of these processes12,13. Although CUE has the potential to act as a predictor of variation in SOC storage, the role of CUE in SOC persistence remains unresolved7,14,15. Here we examine the relationship between CUE and the preservation of SOC, and interactions with climate, vegetation and edaphic properties, using a combination of global-scale datasets, a microbial-process explicit model, data assimilation, deep learning and meta-analysis. We find that CUE is at least four times as important as other evaluated factors, such as carbon input, decomposition or vertical transport, in determining SOC storage and its spatial variation across the globe. In addition, CUE shows a positive correlation with SOC content. Our findings point to microbial CUE as a major determinant of global SOC storage. Understanding the microbial processes underlying CUE and their environmental dependence may help the prediction of SOC feedback to a changing climate.},

  abstract = {We present a reliable and robust open dynamic chamber for measuring greenhouse gas exchange in peatlands with minimal disturbance of the ground. This chamber, called the ``skirt chamber'', is based on a transparent plastic film placed above an open frame made of sparse interwoven wires and expanded around the base of the chamber below a steel chain that ensures contact to the ground, avoiding damage, trenching, and cutting vegetation. Gas exchange is determined using a portable gas analyzer from a mass balance in which the imperfect sealing of the chamber to the ground is quantified through the injection of a methane pulse. The method was tested on a pristine peatland dominated by Sphagnum magellanicum located on Navarino Island in the subantarctic Magellanic ecoregion in Chile. Our results indicate that the skirt chamber allowed the determination of methane fluxes and ecosystem respiration in about 20 min, with a limit of detection of 0.185 mg CH4 m-2 h-1 and 173 mg CO2 m-2 h-1, respectively. We conclude that the skirt chamber is a minimally intrusive, fast, portable, and inexpensive method that allows the quantification of greenhouse gas emissions with high spatial resolution in remote locations and without delay.},

Here, we analysed 3717 incubations of two uniform litter types, green and rooibos tea, buried at 330 circum-Arctic and alpine sites to quantify the effects of temperature, moisture and litter quality on decomposition. We found a surprisingly linear positive relationship between decomposition and soil temperature across all sites, counter to theory and previous model estimates. Litter mass loss was greater at wetter sites, even where soils reached almost full water saturation. However, litter quality was the strongest driver of litter mass loss across the tundra biome, explaining six times more variation in summer decomposition than soil temperature. Our results indicate that climate warming will directly increase decomposition across tundra environments. However, the indirect effects of climate change on vegetation communities, and thus plant litter inputs and quality, could have a more profound impact than direct effects on the balance of this globally important carbon store.},

  abstract = {In climate change ecology, simplistic research approaches may yield unrealistically simplistic answers to often more complicated problems. In particular, the complexity of vegetation responses to global climate change begs a better understanding of the impacts of concomitant changes in several climatic drivers, how these impacts vary across different climatic contexts, and of the demographic processes underlying population changes. Using a replicated, factorial, whole-community transplant experiment, we investigated regional variation in demographic responses of plant populations to increased temperature and/or precipitation. Across four perennial forb species and 12 sites, we found strong responses to both temperature and precipitation change. Changes in population growth rates were mainly due to changes in survival and clonality. In three of the four study species, the combined increase in temperature and precipitation reflected nonadditive, antagonistic interactions of the single climatic changes for population growth rate and survival, while the interactions were additive and synergistic for clonality. This disparity affects the persistence of genotypes, but also suggests that the mechanisms behind the responses of the vital rates differ. In addition, survival effects varied systematically with climatic context, with wetter and warmer + wetter transplants showing less positive or more negative responses at warmer sites. The detailed demographic approach yields important mechanistic insights into how concomitant changes in temperature and precipitation affect plants, which makes our results generalizable beyond the four study species. Our comprehensive study design illustrates the power of replicated field experiments in disentangling the complex relationships and patterns that govern climate change impacts across real-world species and landscapes.},

Zeppelin (78{$^\circ$}56' N, 11{$^\circ$}53' E, 474 m a.s.l.), Ny {\AA}lesund, Svalbard). We provide statistics on both seasonal and diurnal characteristics of the aerosol observations and conclude that the Arctic aerosol number size distribution and related parameters such as integral mass and surface area exhibit a very pronounced seasonal variation. This seasonal variation seems to be controlled by both dominating source as well as meteorological conditions. Three distinctly different periods can be identified during the Arctic year: the haze period characterized by a dominating accumulation mode aerosol (March--May), followed by the sunlit summer period with low abundance of accumulation mode particles but high concentration of small particles which are likely to be recently and locally formed (June--August). The rest of the year is characterized by a comparably low concentration of accumulation mode particles and negligible abundance of ultrafine particles (September--February). A minimum in aerosol mass and number concentration is usually observed during September/October. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} We further show that the transition between the different regimes is fast, suggesting rapid change in the conditions defining their appearance. A source climatology based on trajectory analysis is provided, and it is shown that there is a strong seasonality of dominating source areas, with Eurasia dominating during the Autumn--Winter period and dominance of North Atlantic air during the summer months. We also show that new-particle formation events are rather common phenomena in the Arctic during summer, and this is the result of photochemical production of nucleating/condensing species in combination with low condensation sink. It is also suggested that wet removal may play a key role in defining the Arctic aerosol year, via the removal of accumulation mode size particles, which in turn have a pivotal role in facilitating the conditions favorable for new-particle formation events. In summary the aerosol Arctic year seems to be at least qualitatively predictable based on the knowledge of seasonality of transport paths and associated source areas, meteorological conditions and removal processes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Generality in understanding biodiversity responses to climate change has been hampered by substantial variation in the rates and even directions of response to a given change in climate. We propose that such context dependencies can be clarified by rescaling climate gradients in terms of the underlying biological processes, with biotic interactions as a particularly important process. We tested this rescaling approach in a replicated field experiment where entire montane grassland communities were transplanted in the direction of expected temperature and/or precipitation change. In line with earlier work, we found considerable variation across sites in community dynamics in response to climate change. However, these complex context dependencies could be substantially reduced or eliminated by rescaling climate drivers in terms of proxies of plant-plant interactions. Specifically, bryophytes limited colonization by new species into local communities, whereas the cover of those colonists, along with bryophytes, were the primary drivers of local extinctions. These specific interactions are relatively understudied, suggesting important directions for future work in similar systems. More generally, the success of our approach in explaining and simplifying landscape-level variation in climate change responses suggests that developing and testing proxies for relevant underlying processes could be a fruitful direction for building more general models of biodiversity response to climate change.},

  abstract = {Responses of the terrestrial biosphere to rapidly changing environmental conditions are a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. In an effort to reduce this uncertainty, a wide range of global change experiments have been conducted that mimic future conditions in terrestrial ecosystems, manipulating CO2, temperature, and nutrient and water availability. Syntheses of results across experiments provide a more general sense of ecosystem responses to global change, and help to discern the influence of background conditions such as climate and vegetation type in determining global change responses. Several independent syntheses of published data have yielded distinct databases for specific objectives. Such parallel, uncoordinated initiatives carry the risk of producing redundant data collection efforts and have led to contrasting outcomes without clarifying the underlying reason for divergence. These problems could be avoided by creating a publicly available, updatable, curated database. Here, we report on a global effort to collect and curate 57,089 treatment responses across 3644 manipulation experiments at 1145 sites, simulating elevated CO2, warming, nutrient addition, and precipitation changes. In the resulting Manipulation Experiments Synthesis Initiative (MESI) database, effects of experimental global change drivers on carbon and nutrient cycles are included, as well as ancillary data such as background climate, vegetation type, treatment magnitude, duration, and, unique to our database, measured soil properties. Our analysis of the database indicates that most experiments are short term (one or few growing seasons), conducted in the USA, Europe, or China, and that the most abundantly reported variable is aboveground biomass. We provide the most comprehensive multifactor global change database to date, enabling the research community to tackle open research questions, vital to global policymaking. The MESI database, freely accessible at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7153253, opens new avenues for model evaluation and synthesis-based understanding of how global change affects terrestrial biomes.

  abstract = {Responses of the terrestrial biosphere to rapidly changing environmental conditions are a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. In an effort to reduce this uncertainty, a wide range of global change experiments have been conducted that mimic future conditions in terrestrial ecosystems, manipulating CO2, temperature, nutrient and water availability. Syntheses of results across experiments provide a more general sense of ecosystem responses to global change, and help to discern the influence of background conditions such as climate and vegetation type in determining global change responses. Several independent syntheses of published data have yielded distinct databases for specific objectives. Such parallel, uncoordinated initiatives carry the risk of producing redundant data collection efforts and have led to contrasting outcomes without clarifying the underlying reason for divergence. These problems could be avoided by creating a publicly available, updatable, curated database. Here, we report on a global effort to collect and curate 57,089 treatment responses across 3,644 manipulation experiments at 1,145 sites, simulating elevated CO2, warming, nutrient addition and precipitation changes. In the resulting Manipulation Experiments Synthesis Initiative (MESI) database, effects of experimental global change drivers on carbon and nutrient cycles are included, as well as ancillary data such as background climate, vegetation type, treatment magnitude, duration, and, unique to our database, measured soil properties. Our analysis of the database indicates that most experiments are short-term (one or few growing seasons), conducted in the USA, Europe or China, and that the most abundantly reported variable is aboveground biomass. We provide the most comprehensive multifactor global change database to date, enabling the research community to tackle open research questions, vital to global policymaking. The MESI database, freely accessible at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7153253, opens new avenues for model evaluation and synthesis-based understanding of how global change affects terrestrial biomes. We welcome contributions to the database on GitHub.},

  abstract = {Human-induced nutrient eutrophication is a major threat to grassland biodiversity, because it promotes the dominance of fast-growing plants. Negative impacts of fertilization on plant biodiversity may be offset by grazing by large vertebrate herbivores. However, whether grazers also mitigate impacts of nutrient addition on insects is less well understood. We use a field experiment to test how plant communities and abundances of pollinators and grasshoppers respond to nutrient addition and grazing by different assemblages of large herbivores, i.e. access by all herbivores (including cattle and horses), access by wild herbivores only (wild boar and deer), no access by large herbivores. Plant biomass increased, plant diversity decreased and community composition shifted towards lower forb cover in response to fertilization, but only in the absence of all herbivores. Flower visitation by Hymenoptera (bees and wasps), i.e. the most abundant pollinator group, was reduced by nutrient addition only in the absence of all herbivores and was positively related to flowering plant richness. In contrast, flower visitation by Diptera (e.g. hoverflies) was enhanced by fertilization, but not affected by grazing. Orthoptera (grasshopper) abundance was reduced by grazing and enhanced by nutrient addition, with positive impacts of fertilization tending to be stronger in plots with only wild or no herbivores. The abundance of grasshoppers was positively related to grass biomass. We conclude that vertebrate herbivores can offset impacts of fertilization on both plant and insect communities, making grazing by large mammals an essential tool to protect insects, particularly pollinators. Most responses to nutrient addition were only apparent in plots without any large herbivores, suggesting that wild herbivores alone could already mitigate nutrient impacts. We also show that insects with contrasting feeding guilds may be favoured by fertilized, ungrazed conditions. Therefore, creating a mosaic of patches grazed at different intensities will enhance overall insect biodiversity.},

Yet, little is known about how tundra litter decomposition varies with microenvironmental conditions, hindering accurate projections of tundra soil carbon dynamics with future climate change. Over 14 months, we measured landscape-scale decomposition of two contrasting standard litter types (Green tea and Rooibos tea) in 90 plots covering gradients of micro-climate and -topography, vegetation cover and traits, and soil characteristics in Western Greenland. We used the tea bag index (TBI) protocol to estimate relative variation in litter mass loss, decomposition rate (k) and stabilisation factor (S) across space, and structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify relationships among environmental factors and decomposition. Contrasting our expectations, microenvironmental factors explained little of the observed variation in both litter mass loss, as well as k and S, suggesting that the variables included in our study were not the major controls of decomposer activity in the soil across the studied tundra landscape. We use these unexpected findings of our study combined with findings from the current literature to discuss future avenues for improving our understanding of the drivers of tundra decomposition and, ultimately, carbon cycling across the warming Arctic.},

However, the biosphere-climate feedback to elevated precipitation (eP) remains elusive. Here, we report a study on one of the longest field experiments assessing the effects of eP, alone or in combination with other climate change drivers such as elevated CO2 (eCO2), warming and nitrogen deposition. Soil total carbon (C) decreased after a decade of eP treatment, while plant root production decreased after 2 years. To explain this asynchrony, we found that the relative abundances of fungal genes associated with chitin and protein degradation increased and were positively correlated with bacteriophage genes, suggesting a potential viral shunt in C degradation. In addition, eP increased the relative abundances of microbial stress tolerance genes, which are essential for coping with environmental stressors. Microbial responses to eP were phylogenetically conserved. The effects of eP on soil total C, root production, and microbes were interactively affected by eCO2. Collectively, we demonstrate that long-term eP induces soil C loss, owing to changes in microbial community composition, functional traits, root production, and soil moisture. Our study unveils an important, previously unknown biosphere-climate feedback in Mediterranean-type water-limited ecosystems, namely how eP induces soil C loss via microbe-plant--soil interplay.},

Over the last three years, significant progress has been made in understanding some of the key processes and their representation in global land models. They include the significance of plant--microbial interaction in affecting nutrient cycles, inorganic soil phosphorus transformation, and nitrogen release from rocks. As a result, our understanding of the linkages among geology, biology, and climate controlling nutrient cycles is improving. However, progress in modelling nutrient cycles at a global scale is still confronted with large uncertainties in representing key processes owing to lack of data at the relevant scales for evaluating coupled carbon and nutrient cycles. Here we recommend two approaches to advance modelling of land nutrient cycles: the application of machine learning techniques to bridge the gap between global modelling and scattered site-level information and the use of optimality principles to identify key mechanisms driving spatial and temporal patterns of nutrients.},

  abstract = {Plant mycorrhizal associations influence the accumulation and persistence of soil organic matter and could therefore shape ecosystem biogeochemical responses to global changes that are altering forest composition. For instance, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree dominance is increasing in temperate forests, and ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM) shrubs can respond positively to canopy disturbances. Yet how shifts in the co-occurrence of trees and shrubs with different mycorrhizal associations will affect soil organic matter pools remains largely unknown. We examine the effects of ErM shrubs on soil carbon and nitrogen stocks and indicators of microbial activity at different depths across gradients of AM versus ectomycorrhizal (EcM) tree dominance in three temperate forest sites. We find that ErM shrubs strongly modulate tree mycorrhizal dominance effects. In surface soils, ErM shrubs increase particulate organic matter accumulation and weaken the positive relationship between soil organic matter stocks and indicators of microbial activity. These effects are strongest under AM trees that lack fungal symbionts that can degrade organic matter. In subsurface soil organic matter pools, by contrast, tree mycorrhizal dominance effects are stronger than those of ErM shrubs. Ectomycorrhizal tree dominance has a negative influence on particulate and mineral-associated soil organic matter pools, and these effects are stronger for nitrogen than for carbon stocks. Our findings suggest that increasing co-occurrence of ErM shrubs and AM trees will enhance particulate organic matter accumulation in surface soils by suppressing microbial activity while having little influence on mineral-associated organic matter in subsurface soils. Our study highlights the importance of considering interactions between co-occurring plant mycorrhizal types, as well as their depth-dependent effects, for projecting changes in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in response to compositional shifts in temperate forests driven by disturbances and global change.},

This region is of global importance in terms of carbon feedbacks to climate, yet the sign (sink or source) and magnitude of the Arctic-boreal carbon budget within recent years remains highly uncertain. Here, we provide new estimates of recent (2003--2015) vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Reco), net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE; Reco - GPP), and terrestrial methane (CH4) emissions for the Arctic-boreal zone using a satellite data-driven process-model for northern ecosystems (TCFM-Arctic), calibrated and evaluated using measurements from {$>$}60 tower eddy covariance (EC) sites. We used TCFM-Arctic to obtain daily 1-km2 flux estimates and annual carbon budgets for the pan-Arctic-boreal region. Across the domain, the model indicated an overall average NEE sink of -850 Tg CO2-C year-1. Eurasian boreal zones, especially those in Siberia, contributed to a majority of the net sink. In contrast, the tundra biome was relatively carbon neutral (ranging from small sink to source). Regional CH4 emissions from tundra and boreal wetlands (not accounting for aquatic CH4) were estimated at 35 Tg CH4-C year-1. Accounting for additional emissions from open water aquatic bodies and from fire, using available estimates from the literature, reduced the total regional NEE sink by 21\% and shifted many far northern tundra landscapes, and some boreal forests, to a net carbon source. This assessment, based on in situ observations and models, improves our understanding of the high-latitude carbon status and also indicates a continued need for integrated site-to-regional assessments to monitor the vulnerability of these ecosystems to climate change.},

  abstract = {Major displacement of arctic-alpine species towards higher elevations and latitudes is anticipated under climate warming. Disjunct plant populations persisting on mountains at the limits of their species' distributions may have a reduced capacity for migration, and therefore offer a particularly sensitive indication of climate change effects. The flora of Scotland's mountains is of international significance because it contains populations of climate relicts which are isolated geographically and located at the rear edge of their global range. We used a unique long-term monitoring dataset recording vegetation change at a mountain outpost site in the Scottish Highlands to identify divergent population trends in ten rare plant species over the last 30~years. Three arctic-alpine specialists (Sagina nivalis, Sabulina rubella and Saxifraga cernua) have suffered severe declines of over 50~\% of their population size since the mid-1990s, and have been extirpated at their lowest altitude locations. These species are undergoing elevational range contractions and Sagina nivalis is now considered Endangered in Britain. Their open, gravelly snowbed habitats have been affected by vegetation encroachment, landslip and rockfalls. Population changes across all species studied were also significantly related to altitude. Species with stable or increasing population sizes occur at lower altitudes, are taller and have less reliance on sparsely vegetated habitats. These results can be contextualised within broad trends of thermophilization, biotic homogenization, mountain greening and snow cover declines. Our work demonstrates that disjunct low-latitude arctic-alpine plant populations already situated at maximum local elevational gradients could face ``mountaintop extinction'', with implications for the conservation of regional biodiversity.},

Changes in terrestrial snow-free albedo (e.g. changes in vegetation or surface water) could also affect Earth's energy balance, but their importance for contemporary climate change is relatively unknown. Here we show that changes in surface water are significantly altering Artic-boreal albedo, and explain up to 27\% of the spatial variation in monthly albedo change from 2000 to 2019. The increase in radiative forcing due to changes in surface water extent is most pronounced in the continuous permafrost zone, contributing to a positive feedback between permafrost thaw and climate change. Additionally, we show that fire history and changes in tree cover and surface water extent together account for at least 15\% of albedo-induced radiative forcing over the study period, indicating that these processes are a regionally important aspect of the climate-albedo feedback.},

Time-integrated NDVI (TI-NDVI) from MODIS and observed temperatures (2000--2012) have been combined with a downscaled regional climate model (HIRHAM5) in order to establish a spatio-temporal model for future TI-NDVI, thus forecasting the dry biomass production available for sheep farming in steps of decades for the next 85years. The model has been validated against observed biomass production and the present distribution of fields. Future biomass production is used to discuss the expansion of current farms and to identify new suitable areas for sheep farming. Interestingly, new suitable areas are located where sheep farms were situated during the Norse era more than 1000years ago; areas which have been abandoned for the past 500years. The study highlights the potential of establishing new areas for sheep farming in Arctic Greenland, where current and future climate changes are markedly amplified compared to global trends. However, for the study area the MCE model clearly indicates that the potential of expansion relies on contemporary infrastructural development.},

  abstract = {Climate measurements are needed at a scale at which organisms live and die. Currently available climate sensors, however, are not well suited for long-term field measurements at such a scale. We have therefore developed a new temperature and moisture logger, the Temperature-Moisture-Sensor (TMS), which we designed for a wide range of ecological applications. The device mimics a small herbaceous plant. Its belowground part houses a patented, proprietary soil moisture sensor working on the time-domain transmission principle. Air, surface and soil temperatures are measured simultaneously by three independent sensors. The TMS data logger has a large memory and long battery life, so it is suitable for taking long-term microclimate measurements in the field. With a data acquisition interval of 15\,min, it has sufficient memory to last for almost 15 years. We have thoroughly tested the TMS logger both in the laboratory and in demanding field conditions ranging from tropical rain forests of Africa to high-elevation cold deserts of the Himalayas. The device has provided microclimate measurements in a wide range of environmental conditions and has also performed well in controlled laboratory settings. The key added value of the TMS logger is that it concurrently measures soil moisture as well as soil, surface and air temperature at a biologically relevant scale. It is also able to continuously measure the microclimate for several years even in the most extreme conditions. The device can therefore be used to build extensive tailored field measurement networks providing crucial data about microclimate conditions shaping biological processes in the face of climate change.},

We developed ensembles of multiple models at an unprecedented global scale for five ES of high policy relevance. Ensembles were 2 to 14\% more accurate than individual models. Ensemble accuracy was not correlated with proxies for research capacity, indicating that accuracy is distributed equitably across the globe and that countries less able to research ES suffer no accuracy penalty. By making these ES ensembles and associated accuracy estimates freely available, we provide globally consistent ES information that can support policy and decision-making in regions with low data availability or low capacity for implementing complex ES models. Thus, we hope to reduce the capacity and certainty gaps impeding local- to global-scale movement toward ES sustainability.},

  abstract = {Fluxes of greenhouse gases are a critical component of the earth's natural climate, but anthropogenic emissions have created an imbalance and resulted in global climate change. Quantifying the emission of these gases is vital to our understanding of their sources and sinks, both natural and anthropogenic. The static chamber method, in which a system of interest is enclosed, and gas concentrations are measured over time, is widely used to estimate fluxes of greenhouse gases. With the development of instruments such as infrared gas analyzers (IRGAs) supporting high-frequency concentration data, there is a growing need for open-source workflows to calculate fluxes. Here we present fluxfinder, an R package designed to support reproducible calculations and processing of greenhouse gas fluxes measured with the static chamber method. The package includes raw data file parsing from widely used IRGAs, metadata matching, unit conversion, flux estimations, and initial quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC). Diagnostic graphical plots provide a transparent way to differentiate between measurement issues and nonlinear behavior. The package is also designed to be easily integrated with the gasfluxes package for further fitting of nonlinear concentration-time models, allowing alternative or additional flux QA/QC. The fluxfinder package offers a flexible workflow that is easily adaptable to promote open and reproducible greenhouse gas flux estimations.},

In previous studies a simple vent tube connecting to the chamber has often been used to maintain pressure equilibrium. This approach, however, can be effective only under calm conditions. Under windy conditions, negative pressure excursions will occur inside the chamber that are artifacts resulting from wind passing over the vent tube's external open end, a phenomenon known as the Venturi effect. This causes anomalous mass flow of CO2-rich air from the soil into the chamber, leading to a significant overestimation of FCO2. In this present study, we found that negative chamber pressure excursions due to the Venturi effect cannot be observed unless the differential pressure measurement is made with the chamber resting on an impermeable base. Making pressure measurements with a chamber resting on porous soil can lead to the erroneous conclusion that an anomalous mass flow is not a problem precisely when it is causing serious artifacts.

  abstract = {Anthropogenic warming and land-use change are expected to accelerate global soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and change plant species composition and richness. However, how changes in plant composition and species richness mediate SOC responses to climate warming and land-use change remains poorly understood. Using data from a 7-year warming and clipping field experiment in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai--Tibetan Plateau, we examined the direct effects of warming and clipping on SOC storage versus their indirect effects mediated by plant functional type and species richness. We found that warming significantly increased SOC storage by 8.1\% and clipping decreased it by 6.4\%, which was closely correlated with the corresponding response of below-ground net primary productivity (BNPP). We also found a negative correlation between SOC storage and species richness, which was ascribed to the increased BNPP via enhancing the dominance of grasses and decreasing species richness under warming. The lower SOC storage under clipping was caused by the clipping-induced decrease in BNPP via weakening the dominance of grasses and increasing species richness. Our findings highlight that the SOC storage in this alpine meadow under climate warming and clipping was primarily governed by BNPP changes, which was mediated by changes in the dominance of grasses and species richness. Overall, our study demonstrates that shifting to the dominance of grasses and changing species richness would benefit soil C sequestration under climate warming, but this positive effect would be dampened by grazing or hay harvest.

  abstract = {Long-term monitoring, space-for-time substitutions along gradients, and in situ temperature manipulations are common approaches to understand effects of climate change on alpine and arctic plant communities. Although general patterns emerge from studies using different approaches, there are also some inconsistencies. To provide better estimates of plant community responses to future warming across a range of environments, there have been repeated calls for integrating different approaches within single studies. Thus, to examine how different methods in climate change effect studies may ask different questions, we combined three climate warming approaches in a single study in the Hengduan Mountains of southwestern China. We monitored plant communities along an elevation gradient using the space-for-time approach, and conducted warming experiments using open top chambers (OTCs) and plant community transplantation toward warmer climates along the same gradient. Plant species richness and abundances were monitored over 5 years addressing two questions: (1) how do plant communities respond to the different climate warming approaches? (2) how can the combined approaches improve predictions of plant community responses to climate change? The general trend across all three approaches was decreased species richness with climate warming at low elevations. This suggests increased competition from immigrating lowland species, and/or from the species already growing inside the plots, as indicated by increased biomass, vegetation height or proportion of graminoids. At the coldest sites, species richness decreased in OTCs and along the gradient, but increased in the transplants, suggesting that plant communities in colder climates are more open to invasion from lowland species, with slow species loss. This was only detected in the transplants, showing that different approaches, may yield different results. Whereas OTCs may constrain immigration of new species, transplanted communities are rapidly exposed to new neighbors that can easily colonize the small plots. Thus, different approaches ask slightly different questions, in particular regarding indirect climate change effects, such as biotic interactions. To better understand both direct and indirect effects of climate change on plant communities, we need to combine approaches in future studies, and if novel interactions are of particular interest, transplants may be a better approach than OTCs.},

Based on ERA5 reanalysis during 1979--2020, both AP and TP have undergone significant warming with an annual rate of 0.72~{$^\circ$}C/decade and 0.34~{$^\circ$}C/decade respectively, which exceeds the rates for the Northern Hemisphere (0.29~{$^\circ$}C/decade) and the global means (0.19~{$^\circ$}C/decade) over the same period. Based on 22 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models, AA over the AP is warming at a rate almost four times than the global means and twice as fast over the TP. Although both AA and TA are projected to continue in the future, currently there is no consensus on the dominant mechanisms for AA or TA over the two Poles. Proposed mechanisms of AA can be divided into two types: local climate factors (sea ice-albedo feedback, Planck feedback, temperature gradient feedback, cloud feedback, and water vapor feedback); and poleward heat and moisture transport from lower latitudes (atmospheric circulation effect, ocean circulation effect, and modulation of Pacific and Atlantic SST). Consequences of AA include decline of sea ice cover, retreat of the Greenland ice sheet, permafrost degradation, accelerated disturbances in marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and influences on extreme climate events at lower latitudes. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission, snow/ice-albedo feedback, cloud-radiation interactions, water vapor and radiative flux feedbacks, local forcing and feedback processes, land use changes and reduction in total ozone, are generally considered to be the main mechanisms causing TA. TA has caused significant change within the atmosphere and cryosphere over the TP and its surroundings, such as changes in climate extremes, snow cover, the retreat of glaciers, and permafrost degradation. Similarities and differences of warming amplifications over the two Poles are proposed, and the relative contribution of each mechanism to the warming amplifications and how the specific consequences may compare over the two Poles remain unclear and under continuing investigation.},

  abstract = {The Arctic warming rate is triple the global average, which is partially caused by surface albedo feedback (SAF). Understanding the varying pattern of SAF and the mechanisms is therefore critical for predicting future Arctic climate under anthropogenic warming. To date, however, how the spatial pattern of seasonal SAF is influenced by various land surface factors remains unclear. Here, we aim to quantify the strengths of seasonal SAF across the Arctic and to attribute its spatial heterogeneity to the dynamics of vegetation, snow and soil as well as their interactions. The results show a large positive SAF above -5\% K-1 across Baffin Island in January and eastern Yakutia in June, while a large negative SAF beyond 5\% K-1 is observed in Canada, Chukotka and low latitudes of Greenland in January and Nunavut, Baffin Island and Krasnoyarsk Krai in July. Overall, a great spatial heterogeneity of Arctic land warming induced by positive SAF is found with a coefficient of variation (CV) larger than 61.5\%, and the largest spatial difference is detected in wintertime with a CV {$>$} 643.9\%. Based on the optimal parameter-based geographic detector model, the impacts of snow cover fraction (SCF), land cover type (LC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil water content (SW), soil substrate chemistry (SC) and soil type (ST) on the spatial pattern of positive SAF are quantified. The rank of determinant power is SCF {$>$} LC {$>$} NDVI {$>$} SW {$>$} SC {$>$} ST, which indicates that the spatial patterns of snow cover, land cover and vegetation coverage dominate the spatial heterogeneity of positive SAF in the Arctic. The interactions between SCF, LC and SW exert further influences on the spatial pattern of positive SAF in March, June and July. This work could provide a deeper understanding of how various land factors contribute to the spatial heterogeneity of Arctic land warming at the annual cycle.},

A planned spatially large-scale campaign incites us to implement our ultra-low-cost portative chamber. The chamber itself is entirely built from commercial parts with little, easy-to-perform, quick machining work. The resulting setup is an easy-to-operate, standalone, robust device. The used sensors are cost-effective yet accurate digital sensors that were successfully checked against some reference sensors. All of these characteristics made the described chamber accessible to build and use for a wide scientific and educational community.

  abstract = {Terrestrial carbon (C) cycling in high Arctic tundra depends on ecosystem responses to climatic warming and concurrent changes in environmental conditions. There are very few studies to quantify long-term C budget in high Arctic tundra due to lack of sufficient measurements. Here based on well-established multiyear measurements, we calibrated a process-oriented model (CoupModel) to quantify various components of the C budget at a Cassiope tetragona heath ecosystem in northeast Greenland. Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) for 2000--2014 was estimated at -15 {\textpm} 10 g C m-2 yr-1. Ecosystem respiration (ER) for nongrowing seasons was estimated at 10.3 {\textpm} 5.3 g C m-2 yr-1, representing around 13\% of the annual ER. Significant trends for interannual variations of aboveground and belowground C fluxes and stocks were found for the subperiods (i.e., 2000--2008 and 2008--2014) but not for the entire period. Interannual variations of NEE largely relied on the response of gross primary production (GPP) and ER to seasonal changes in climate. Moreover, the model showed that interannual variations of GPP, ER, and NEE had a much higher linear correlation with July temperature and annual maximum thawing depth (ALDmax) than other climatic and site characteristics. ALDmax had the highest correlation with the decomposition rate of humus C. Overall, this modeling study suggests that a sink-source transition of the studied ecosystem depends on ecosystem responses to interannual variations of climate and that the net C balance may be sensitive to summer warmth and active layer thickness.},

  abstract = {Automated transparent chambers have gained increasing popularity in recent years to continuously measure net CO2 fluxes between low-statured canopies and the atmosphere. In this study, we carried out four field campaigns with chamber measurements in a variety of mountainous grasslands. A mathematic stationary point (or critical point, a point at which the derivative of a function is zero) in the CO2 mixing ratio time series was found in a substantial fraction of the measurements at all the sites, which had a significant influence on the performances of the regression algorithms. The stationary point was probably due to condensed water on the inner wall of the chamber dome, which reduced the solar radiation and resulted in a reversal of the CO2 mixing ratio time series in the chamber (so called Clouded-Glass Effect or CGE in this study). This effect may be the cause of the observed underestimation of daytime CO2 fluxes when using common linear and exponential regression models on continuous automated chamber observations. In order to avoid biased flux estimation of daytime CO2 fluxes, we introduced a linearly increasing term to the exponential function so as to compensate for the influence of the CGE, which gives acceptable model errors and improves the CO2 flux estimation by 5\% for temperate mountainous grasslands. We conclude that exponential regression models should be favoured over linear models and recommend to account for the effects of CGE by either excluding ambiguous observations from the flux computations where stationary points can be identified in the CO2 mixing ratio time series, or by adding a linearly increasing term to the exponential regression model.},

Yet, how an increasing number of global changes impact the resistance of ecosystems to global change remains virtually unknown. Here we present a global synthesis including 14,000 observations from seven ecosystem services (functions and biodiversity), as well as data from a 15-year field experiment. We found that the resistance of multiple ecosystem services to global change declines with an increasing number of global change factors, particularly after long-term exposure to these factors. Biodiversity had a higher resistance to multiple global changes compared with ecosystem functions. Our work suggests that we need to consider the combined effects of multiple global changes on the magnitude and resistance of ecosystem services worldwide, as ecosystem responses will be enhanced by the number of environmental stressors and time of exposure.},
